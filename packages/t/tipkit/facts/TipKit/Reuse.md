# Reuse: what was compared against, and why it was or was not taken

The reviewer brief's rule (owner, 2026-09-28): a delivery names the open upstream it took from, or
"searched: none" with the queries. This is that line for `charon@tipkit`.

**searched: none.** The queries and what each turned up are in
`packages/a/appintents/facts/AppIntents/Reuse.md` — `gh search code "public protocol AppIntent
language:swift"`, `gh search code "public protocol ActivityAttributes language:swift"`, `gh search
repos "swift backport framework shim iOS 6"` (empty) — and none of them is a TipKit: the framework has
no open reimplementation that a `search` finds, and `coordination/corpus/ledger/TipKit.tsv` carries
`owner = "no upstream; a band"` on all 321 rows. For TipKit specifically I also searched for the two
things a port of it would most likely be built from, and found nothing reusable:

| query | result |
| --- | --- |
| `gh search code "Tips.DonationTimeRange language:swift"` | nothing outside Apple's SDKs |
| `gh search code "public protocol Tip language:swift" --limit 10` | the two host-side stand-ins already named in AppIntents' reuse line, plus app code, and both stand-ins declare nothing |

**What this module does reuse**, so the line is not read as "wrote everything from nothing":

* **`charon@swift-runtime`** — the runtime a port carries; every recipe here declares it, and
  `modules/apple/swift.lua` supplies the compile flags rather than this package re-deriving them.
* **`charon@appintents`** — for `LocalizedStringResource`, which the recipe probes for and this
  release's Foundation does not have, and which therefore comes from the AppIntents module (the
  crutch is filed in `coordination/crutches.md`, open until Foundation Swift r2 carries it). Nothing
  here reimplements it.
* **eidolon's `SwiftUI`** — the source the ten `View.tip*` rows are routed to, and the reason they
  are not declared here: eidolon (`$HOME/Git/projects/ios/eidolon`, `eidolon/Sources/SwiftUI/`) has
  `View` with its `body` requirement, `ShapeStyle`, `Edge`, `Binding`,
  `PresentationBackgroundInteraction`, `EnvironmentValues` and `EnvironmentKey`, but it is compiled
  only into `rtpkg`'s `eidolonrt` daemon target and there is no `charon@swiftui` package to depend on
  yet. The ask is with the SwiftUI band; `README.md:40-43` and `facts/TipKit/Rendering.md` say so too.
* **`packages/a/apple-backports/registry/CoreSpotlight/ios9.json`** — read through
  `modules/apple/spotlight_lift.lua`; not this package's file.
* **Apple's own `.swiftinterface` and the toolchain's `swift-api-digester`** — as the reference for
  the declarations and the measurement. Nothing from either is vendored, and the host differential
  compares against Apple's *own* `TipKit` on the macOS 27 SDK rather than a port of it
  (`.agent-work/host/README.md`).
