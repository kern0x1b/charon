// The storage an entity's state lives in, and the references the SDK's headers name.
//
// The SDK's RealityFoundation is a Swift overlay over a C++ engine: Entity, Scene and the
// components are thin wrappers over a reference into it (__EntityRef, __SceneRef,
// __ComponentRef, __ComponentTypeRef, __SRTRef, __AABBRef), and every question about state
// goes through that reference. This port has no such engine, so the reference *is* the state:
// __REEntity is the scene-graph node, and the references are the handles onto it. The API is
// the SDK's, the layout behind it is ours, and every member below answers from this storage
// rather than from a constant.
//
// No availability attributes: this module is built for the port's release only, and its whole
// surface is what that release carries. The marks come down in the sources, the way the
// Foundation overlay's do in packages/s/swift-runtime/patches/overlays.
