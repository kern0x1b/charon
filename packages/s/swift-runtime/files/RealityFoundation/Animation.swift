// Animation: an entity's transform changing over time.

// An animation here is a definition - a value that moves from one state to another over a
// duration, with a timing function and a repeat mode - and a resource that names it. Playing one
// hands back a controller, and the controller is advanced by the same step that advances the
// physics: the render loop, or a program calling `__advancePhysics(deltaTime:)` itself. There is
// no clock of its own, so a frame is what time is.
