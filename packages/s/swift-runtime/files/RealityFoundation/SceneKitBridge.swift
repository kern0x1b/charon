// The bridge to SceneKit: this port's scene graph as an `SCNScene`, which is what a view
// presents.
//
// RealityKit's own `ARView` has an `scnScene`, and the translation from its entity graph to
// SceneKit's is private. This is the same translation, written here so that the meshes and
// materials above are drawn by the SceneKit the backports carry rather than sitting in a
// module with no way out. It is a translation and nothing else: it reads the graph, it does not
// step the simulation and it does not draw.
//
// The SDK's SceneKit apinote has two top-level `Protocols:` keys and Swift's importer refuses
// the module because of it (measured 2026-09-27, iPhoneOS16.4.sdk cccc080d0cbe42c2a85b1369aba6e290:
// `SceneKit.apinotes:141:1: error: duplicated mapping key 'Protocols'` for every target). The
// package merges the two lists into one with files/SceneKit/merge-apinotes.py and hands this
// compile a clang VFS overlay that points the SDK's file at the merged one, so the fix is local
// to this module and the SDK package's hash does not move for any other band.
