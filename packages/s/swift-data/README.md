# charon@swift-data

The SwiftData module for the port's armv7 releases: a Swift module named `SwiftData`, built
against the `charon@swift-runtime` a port carries, so a program writes `import SwiftData`.

The storage is the release's own Core Data - `NSPersistentContainer` and
`NSPersistentStoreDescription` from iOS 6.0, the backports' `NSPersistentHistory*`,
`NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`, `NSBatchDeleteRequest` and `NSFetchIndexDescription` below it -
and this package is the SwiftData API as a layer over it.

What is measured about that substrate, and what the port does and does not have, is in
`facts/SwiftData/Substrate.md`. Two things a caller should read there first: a Swift module
cannot be built for the 4.3 band (the runtime's own `Swift` module has a floor of iOS 6.0, because
every Core Data backport entry has `minimum: 6.0`), and `FetchDescriptor`'s predicate and sort
order are `Foundation.Predicate` and `Foundation.SortDescriptor`, which arrive with
`charon@swift-foundation` and are not on the port yet.

## State of this package

**All 584 of the corpus's SwiftData rows are carried.** The last two were the history:
`ModelContext.fetchHistory(_:)` and `ModelContext.deleteHistory(_:)`, over the backports'
`NSPersistentHistory*` and the `HistoryProviding` conformance the review's first round called a
stub. The **seven** macros are declared with Apple's own `@attached`
roles and compile with no plugin on the machine, because `#externalMacro` is only resolved when a
macro is *used*.

All seven are `kind=function` rows, `Model()` among them: the corpus records a macro as a function
whatever it attaches, so `@Model` is a `function` row and not a `class` row — `@attached(member)`
generates a class, and the row's kind is about how the API table records the declaration, not what
the expansion produces.

**What is not done is the expansion, not the API.** `SwiftDataMacros` - the host executable
`@Model` and the rest expand through - is not written, and it is waiting on `charon@swift-syntax`
(6ae40d50), which publishes the host compiler and the swift-syntax build a plugin is compiled
against. The rule that builds a plugin from sources is `rules/macro/xmake.lua`, from that series;
this package will name it and nothing more.

Built, measured: `swiftc -target armv7-apple-ios6.1.3` over the whole module, the swift-runtime
built with the Core Data backports and swift-foundation's `FoundationEssentials` and
`FoundationInternationalization` on the search path: **0 errors**, a `Mach-O object arm_v7` of
**895464 bytes, 2836 defined and 433 undefined symbols**, the ten swift-foundation ones named in
`facts/SwiftData/Substrate.md` and in `on_test`. `-wmo -c` on its own writes that object;
the bitcode wrapper an earlier run produced came from asking for the module interface in the same
invocation, and a `-emit-library` link of it "succeeded" into a 16428-byte library with **zero**
defined symbols - which is how the check that now prints the counts came to exist.

The link is **not** finished, and for one reason only. The 433 undefined symbols of this build, as
`harness/symbols.lua` prints them, and they add up:

| count | what it is waiting for |
| --- | --- |
| 180 | the Swift runtime and the standard library, both in `libswiftCore`, which a program links |
| 162 | C symbols the frameworks carry |
| 36 | objc classes the frameworks carry |
| 34 | the port's own `Foundation` overlay |
| 7 | `Observation`, the runtime's own |
| 8 | `FoundationEssentials` |
| 3 | `FoundationInternationalization` |
| 430 | everything above |
| 3 | the classifier reading a mangled *generic parameter* as a module name: `_$s5Index…`, `_$s6Element…`, `_$s8Iterator…` are `Index`, `Element` and `Iterator`, not modules. A name it cannot place is counted, not dropped, so the total holds |
| **433** | |

The **11** swift-foundation ones are 8 + 3: `Predicate`, `SortDescriptor`, `Date`, `UUID`. They are
swift-foundation's, and f25214c6's run output is its typecheck-only `check.sh` path, so
`lib_FoundationEssentials.dylib` does not exist anywhere. Every other import of this module resolves
against the runtime and the Core Data backports. The ten are named one by one in
`harness/symbols.lua`, and `on_test` fails when one of them stops being undefined or when an
eleventh appears.

**Which build verifies this package.** `swift-data` is in no `LIBRARIES` and no gate config, so
**the backports gate never builds it** - a green gate says nothing about it. Two things verify it,
and they are different jobs:

- the **armv7 build** is `.agent-work/probe/build.sh <release>`, which runs the flags
  `modules/apple/swift.lua runtime_flags` builds, compiles the whole module and prints the counts.
  At this tip, for `6.1.3`:
  ```
  COMPILE ERRORS 0
  OBJECT  SwiftData.o  895464 bytes  Mach-O object arm_v7
  SYMBOLS defined=2836 undefined=433
  ```
  It is in `.agent-work` because it is a *band's* harness and a package's build belongs to the
  package; the committed half of it is `harness/symbols.lua`, below.
- the **committed check** is `xmake l packages/s/swift-data/harness/symbols.lua` with
  `CHARON_SWIFTDATA_OBJECT` naming an object or the installed `libSwiftData.a`, which prints the same
  `SYMBOLS` and `UNDEFINED` lines and runs the ten-symbol check; and the package's `on_test`, which
  runs that check on what it installed. Its control is the same file with
  `CHARON_SWIFTDATA_CONTROL=1`, which is how the check is shown to fail.

And the build is against swift-runtime `29dd4454` (recipe digest `875c24e4...`), while this tree
at `4d2e24e7` produces `0ccce571...` - the digest 4d2e24e7 regenerated for the backports' UIKit
7-12 and CarPlay series, which are `backports.lua` changes and so can move the lift. The newest
`backports=true` swift-runtime in the store is from 04:34 today, built against the older digest.
**This build has to be re-measured against the runtime this tree produces, and that is a gate-sized
job, not a band-sized one.**

Wired to the store, and the two places are where the wiring is: `DefaultStore` conforms to
`HistoryProviding` and holds `fetchHistory` and `deleteHistory` at
`files/SwiftData/DefaultStore.swift:331`, and `ModelContext.fetchHistory` and `deleteHistory` hand
the descriptor to the store at `files/SwiftData/ModelContext.swift:318`. What is still missing is
`@Model`'s expansion: the seven macro names are declared and the module builds without any plugin, but
a program that writes `@Model` needs `SwiftDataMacros`.

The differential so far is one case, and it is measured on both sides: `.agent-work/probe/model/
MissingValue.swift` is compiled against Apple's SwiftData on the host and typechecked against this
module for armv7, and the host's answer to a value the schema requires and the row does not hold
is a trap with those words - see `facts/SwiftData/Substrate.md`.
