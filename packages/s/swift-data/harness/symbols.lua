-- What an object's undefined symbols are waiting for, and the check that ten of them are the only
-- ones that are not on their way to being resolved.
--
-- The ten are swift-foundation's: FetchDescriptor's predicate and sortBy, HistoryDescriptor's and
-- DataStoreBatchDeleteRequest's are `Foundation.Predicate` and `Foundation.SortDescriptor`, and
-- lib_FoundationEssentials.dylib does not exist because charon@swift-foundation is not in the
-- store. The check is two-sided, and both sides have bitten or would have:
--
--   - a NAMED symbol that is no longer undefined means the library arrived, or the code stopped
--     using it: the list is stale and someone has to look;
--   - an UNLISTED symbol whose module is FoundationEssentials or FoundationInternationalization
--     means a new one was used: the list is incomplete and someone has to add it.
--
-- A one-sided check is a tautology - "the count of things not found is at most the number of
-- things" is always true, which is what on_test had - so both directions are counted and both fail.


-- A global, not a local: xmake's import() returns a module's globals, so a local table
-- would be invisible to on_test and to the control.
