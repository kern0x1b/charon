// AppIntentsMacros: the plugin that expands the macros Apple's own AppIntentsMacros expands, built
// for the host against `charon@swift-syntax` -- the Apache-2.0 upstream at the tag that matches the
// fleet's 6.4 toolchain. Not the toolchain's own copy: that one exports every macro role and *no*
// `CompilerPlugin`, which sits behind `@_spi(PluginMessage)` in `SwiftCompilerPluginMessageHandling`
// (kits r3), so a `-load-plugin-executable` has nothing to conform to.
//
// Every role here is written against the framework's own @attached declaration, printed in
// `arm64e-apple-macos.swiftinterface`:
//
//   @attached(peer, names: prefixed(`$`), prefixed(`_`))
//   @attached(accessor, names: named(get), named(set))
//   public macro ComputedProperty() = #externalMacro(module: "AppIntentsMacros",
//                                                    type: "EntityPropertyMacro")
//
// Apple's plugin is not on this machine to diff against -- the toolchain ships libObservationMacros
// and libSwiftMacros and nothing else -- so the reference is the interface, and
// packages/a/appintents/facts/AppIntents/Macros.md says so rather than implying a diff happened.
