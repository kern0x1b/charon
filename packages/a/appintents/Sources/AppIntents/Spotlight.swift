// What AppIntents adds to the three CoreSpotlight classes, and to a resumed activity.
//
// The three classes are the CoreSpotlight backports' own (`registry/CoreSpotlight/ios9.json`, all
// three `implemented`): the release runs no Spotlight index, and the port keeps the journal itself and
// bridges it to the release's own `SPSpotlightManager`. What AppIntents adds is the association
// between an index entry and the app entity behind it, so that a search result names the entity and a
// caller can find it again.
//
// The classes are marked iOS 9 in the SDK's headers, written `CS_CLASS_AVAILABLE(10_13, 9_0)`, which
// `apple.lift` cannot rewrite and whose framework the lift's `FRAMEWORKS` does not name. The package
// therefore asks for the three of them itself, through `modules/apple/spotlight_lift.lua`, which lowers
// exactly what that registry carries - the three classes, their categories and the members of their
// own surface - and checks both ways; when it could not, this file is left out of the module and the
// rows it holds read `missing` in the ledger, which is what they are. `facts/AppIntents/Spotlight.md`.
