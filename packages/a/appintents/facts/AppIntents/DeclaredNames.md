# The names this series declares that the framework's own interfaces do not

**Reproduce the counts** -- the script is in the tree, and these are the three commands:

    python3 packages/a/appintents/tests/invented-names.py --control   # the refusal, for a missing input
    python3 packages/a/appintents/tests/invented-names.py             # the counts
    python3 packages/a/appintents/tests/invented-names.py --table     # this table

**Where the interfaces come from, and why it is a real path.** The first version read three of the
four from `the 26.2 interface copies, **no longer read**: the census reads the machine's own `charon@iphoneos-sdk` 26.2 install*-ios.swiftinterface` -- files that exist only in the band worktree that
extracted them. The review measured the consequence on a **fresh detached checkout**, where those
paths do not exist: the script silently scored TipKit, WidgetKit and ActivityKit as absent from every
interface, and the counts came out **425 in the interfaces / 223 to explain** against the 573/75 it
printed in my worktree. Each path is now a glob under **`charon@iphoneos-sdk`'s own install of 26.2**
-- the machine's copy of the release the rows are written against, and the same files the worktree
copies came from (TipKit 1279, WidgetKit 1785, ActivityKit 676 lines) -- and a glob matching **no**
file exits non-zero naming the pattern, with `--control` as the test of that property. This store holds
three installs of 26.2, so a glob matching several is read in full and the count printed: which copies
were read is never a silent choice either.

**The counts, from a fresh detached checkout at the previous commit** (the run the review asked for,
in `charon/a fresh detached worktree used to re-record the counts, 2026-09-28; **not kept**`, a checkout with none of my `.agent-work/` in it):

| | |
| --- | --- |
| type-level names declared | 648 across AppIntents, TipKit, WidgetKit, ActivityKit |
| in the module's own interface | **584** |
| `Charon`-prefixed (the port's own, by convention) | **44** |
| **to explain, in the table below** | **64** |
| -- of those, **quoted from the SDK** with the hit | 6 |
| -- of those, **invented by this band**, with the reason in the row | **64** |
| the macro plugin's own tree (`packages/a/appintents-macros`) | 8, all ours by construction |

**The first version of this file was wrong and said so in its own text.** It claimed a dotted or
qualified name is "the framework printing it under a qualified spelling"; the review sampled that and
it is false -- `AnyAppEntity` is in no file of the whole 26.2 SDK, and so are `AnyRange`,
`DateResolver`, `IndexRecord`, `FloatResolver`, `ElementResolver` and `IdentityResolver` (the
controls: `RecurrenceRule` scores 6, `AppIntent` 93). Every row now carries **the SDK hit, quoted**,
or says **invented, with the reason**, and the invented count is printed by every run, so a new
invented name cannot pass as a category.

**The three kinds a row can be.** *A quoted SDK hit* -- the framework's own name, in a `.swiftinterface` or
`.swiftdoc`, and the quote says where. **There are none left.** An earlier
version of the script also read C headers, and it is what produced the 36
"quoted" rows: `Never` out of `dlfcn.h`, and names like that. The search is now
Swift interfaces only, and every one of the 64 has no hit in any of them --
which is what the review measured for the names it sampled. *An SDK type in a framework this band does not read* -- `CLPlacemark` (CoreLocation), the
`CSSearchable*` trio (CoreSpotlight, lifted by `modules/apple/spotlight_lift.lua`, see `Spotlight.md`),
the SwiftUI names, `BundleDescription`; the port names these to use them and declares none.
*Invented by this band* -- its own machinery behind a framework type this release does not carry, or
its own state where the framework keeps state in a store that does not exist here; each such row
carries the reason.

| name | hits in the four interfaces | what it is | invented, with reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AnyAppEntity` | **no hit in any SDK interface or header** | a name this band wrote | **yes** -- the framework's own erasure is a nested type of `AppEntity`; this one answers to the same name and is the port's own spelling of it |
| `AnyRange` | **no hit in any SDK interface or header** | a name this band wrote | **yes** -- the port's own erased range, for the same reason as `AnyAppEntity` |
| `AppShortcutOptionsCollectionSpecificationFor` | **no hit in any SDK interface or header** | a name this band wrote | **yes** -- a name this band wrote for state the framework keeps in a store this release does not have |
| `AppShortcutParameterPresentationProtocol` | **no hit in any SDK interface or header** | a name this band wrote | **yes** -- a value or protocol of the framework's *machinery* -- its store, its parameter resolution and its presentation live in a system this release does not have |
