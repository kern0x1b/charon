# Reuse: what was compared against, and why it was or was not taken

The reviewer brief's rule (owner, 2026-09-28): a delivery names the open upstream it took from, or
"searched: none" with the queries. This is that line for `charon@appintents` and the three kits.

**searched: none** — with the queries that establish it, run 2026-09-28 from the machine:

| query | what it found | why it was not reused |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gh search code "public protocol AppIntent language:swift"` | `littledivy/open-apple-intelligence` → `Sources/OpenAppIntentsAssistant/Core/AppIntentsCore.swift`; `Vercantez/openuikit` → `full/widgetkit/WidgetKitHostLookalikes.swift` | both are **host-side stand-ins that exist only where the framework is absent**: opencuikit's is `#if !canImport(AppIntents)` and declares `public protocol AppIntent: Sendable {}`; the other comments that "the real `AppIntent` requires `static var title` plus a `perform()`". Taking one would place a *missing* framework's rows behind an empty declaration, which is the one outcome the ledger cannot see. |
| `gh search code "public protocol ActivityAttributes language:swift"` | `biagio-incardona/Castor`, `Vercantez/openuikit` → `full/activitykit/ActivityKit.swift` (`#if !canImport(AppIntents)`) | the same shape: an app's own lookalike, not a port of the framework's surface. |
| `gh search repos "swift backport framework shim iOS 6"` | nothing | — |
| `coordination/corpus/ledger/AppIntents.tsv`, `ActivityKit.tsv` | every row carries `owner = "no upstream; a band"` and `needs = swift-module` | the ledger's own answer to the rule, and it says the same thing. |
| `git -C <worktree> diff --stat origin/main..HEAD` over `api-kits` and `api-swift-kits` | no file under any of the four package directories | no other band in the fleet has written any of them, so nothing of ours was duplicated. |

**What *was* reused**, named so the line is not read as "wrote everything from nothing":

* **`charon@swift-runtime`** — the port's own Swift runtime, a package, declared as every recipe's
  dependency. Nothing in the four modules reimplements it.
* **eidolon's `SwiftUI`** — the SwiftUI band, `$HOME/Git/projects/ios/eidolon`
  (`eidolon/Sources/SwiftUI/`): `View` with its `body` requirement (`Core.swift:7-13`), `Text`
  (`Views.swift`), `ShapeStyle`, `Edge`, `Binding`, `PresentationBackgroundInteraction`,
  `EnvironmentValues` (`Graph.swift:8`), `EnvironmentKey` (`Environment.swift:4`). It is the source
  the **view rows are routed to** and the reason they are not declared here: it is compiled only into
  `rtpkg`'s `eidolonrt` daemon target, with no `charon@swiftui` package to depend on, so a port cannot
  build against it yet (`facts/WidgetKit/Providers.md` lists the rows; the ask is with the band).
* **`packages/a/apple-backports/registry/CoreSpotlight/ios9.json`** — the backports package's own
  registry entry, read by the AppIntents recipe through `modules/apple/spotlight_lift.lua`. The
  `scriptdir()` defect that hid it was this delivery's; the registry itself is not ours.
* **Apple's own `.swiftinterface`s and `swift-api-digester`** — as *references* for the declarations
  and for the measurement, which is not reuse of an implementation: nothing from them is vendored.

**Not reused, and worth naming because it is the obvious candidate:** `swift-foundation`. The
`AttributedString`, `Measurement` and `Calendar.RecurrenceRule` rows are gated on it
(`Sources/AppIntents/Gated.swift`, and the recipe's probes, which measure rather than assume). This
delivery carries the *conformances* AppIntents adds to those types and takes the types themselves from
the runtime, which is the Foundation band's to carry; a second copy of `Measurement` here would be a
second copy of something that exists (`AGENTS.md` §4, reuse before writing).
