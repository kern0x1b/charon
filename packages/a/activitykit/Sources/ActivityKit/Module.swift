// ActivityKit: the Live Activities of iOS 16.1.
//
// A Live Activity is not a value the app keeps: it is a registration the system's activity daemon
// (`chronod`) owns, which hands the app a push token to update it with and draws it on the Lock
// Screen and, from iOS 16.1, in the Dynamic Island. iOS 6.1.3 runs no such daemon and the release has
// no Live Activity surface at all, so the framework's own answer for a device that does not support
// Live Activities is the answer this module gives, and gives it by asking, not by asserting: see
// `CharonActivitySupport`. `facts/ActivityKit/Availability.md`.
