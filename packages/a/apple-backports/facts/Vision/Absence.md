# What a release that has Vision answers, and what the two this port deploys on have

Every number below was read out of a cache or out of a framework on this machine, and every one of
them names the command that produced it so a reader can read it again. Nothing here is a reading of
a header: a header carries a name, a type and an availability, and the value of a constant is in the
framework's own image.

## 1. Neither release this port deploys on carries a Vision image

This is the fact every `absent` row of the Vision library rests on, and it is a fact about the two
releases rather than about this port.

```
CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l tools/corpus/cache-census.lua VN 6.1.3 4.3 11.0 12.0
```

```
6.1.3     $HOME/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7
         images 524, of which naming VN 0
         classes 11378, of which VN* 0

         protocols 11426, of which VN* 23 (<the 23 names elided>)
control: 418 name(s) beginning VN found in this run, so a zero on another rung is the release's and not the reader's
```

Two things are changed in that and nothing else: the cache paths carry `$HOME` where the run printed
an absolute home path, which this repository does not track, and the parenthetical lists of the 418
names found on 11.0 and 12.0 are cut where they begin -- the counts are the whole of what the
control is for, and the run's whole output is in the band's run directory.

**The control is the point, and it is in the same run.** A census that prints 0 is ambiguous: the
name may really be absent, or the reader may be looking at the wrong thing, and a zero cannot tell
those apart. 6.1.3 is read through 11 378 classes and 1 171 protocols and carries none beginning
`VN`, and the same reader finds 155 classes and 18 protocols in 11.0 and 222 and 23 in 12.0. The
zero is the release's.

`VN` names nothing among the *images* of either release either, so the images themselves are named
`Vision.framework/Vision`:

```
CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l tools/corpus/cache-census.lua Vision.framework 11.0 12.0
```

```
11.0               images 1258, of which naming Vision.framework 3
12.0               images 1368, of which naming Vision.framework 3
```

Those are the run's `images` lines with the cache paths dropped, which is all of this second census
that section 1 does not already settle.

Which release carried the framework is not the question the rows ask -- the rows ask what 6.1.3 and
4.3 answer, and the answer is that they never had it -- but it is the reason the tree's own
`source` fields for the Vision library read "Vision of the arm64 shared cache of iOS 12.0", and that
is a fact about how the registry was read rather than about when Vision arrived: 11.0 already carries
155 `VN*` classes, so the framework itself arrived with 11.0 and 12.0 is only the rung the names were
read out of.

## 2. Each name of this slice is real, and the first held rung that has it

```
python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py VNClassifyImageRequest VNDetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest \

hasMinimumPrecision:forRecall:                16.0
hasMinimumRecall:forPrecision:                16.0
```

The tool's own separator is a tab; the columns above are aligned by hand and nothing else about them
is changed.

**16.0 is not a version, it is a bound.** The held set is dense to 12.0 and then has a hole -- no
13.0, 14.0 or 15.0 is held -- so a name of 13.0, 14.0 or 15.0 reads as 16.0: after 12.0 and by 16.0.
`tools/release-split.lua` prints the same note in a run of its own. What a row's `introduced` says is
the SDK's annotation, which is this registry's own source, and it is not read out of a cache.

**`VNDetectHumanRectanglesRequest` reads 11.0, and that is not a mistake.** It is a real class of
11.0's Vision, with `VNHumanObservation` and `VNHumanDetector` beside it in the same census, while the
SDK annotates it `ios(13.0)`. A release can carry a class before the release that declares it
public. It changes nothing for a row whose `minimum` is 6.0, because the rung the port deploys on is
6.1.3 and it carries no Vision at all; and it is the reason that row is implemented rather than left
absent, since `modules/apple/backports.lua` refuses a row the release the band runs on carries itself.

## 3. The two constants' values, read out of the image

The value of a constant is Apple's data. For an `NS_TYPED_ENUM` name the header carries the type, the
name and the availability and no value, so nothing about the spelling of the name says what the text
is -- measured on three unrelated names before this one: `MTLCounterErrorDomain` is
`"MTLCounterErrorDomain"`, `PHLivePhotoShouldRenderAtPlaybackTime` is
`"LivePhotoShouldRenderAtPlaybackTime"`, and `CVPixelBufferVersatileBayerKey_BayerPattern` is
`"ProResRAW_BayerPattern"`.

```

`Cat` and `Dog`. Both symbols are exported by the Vision image of the 16.0 arm64e cache -- which is
split, the base file being a header of some 380 KB and the bodies in `.01`, `.03` and `.05`, and
`cache-value.lua` goes through `modules/apple/dyld.lua`'s own `open_cache`, so the slide a stored
pointer carries and the mapping it lands in are undone by the code that already binds them. The
value read is a CFString's chars at +16 and its length at +24 for this ABI, not the first bytes at
whatever the pointer names, and the tool refuses a read wider than the distance to the next export in
the same image.

`VNElementTypeSize` is exported by the same image, at `0x1a17f696c`, and its first word is a code
pointer rather than a pointer to data -- it is a function, and its answers are in section 4.

## 4. What Vision itself answers, measured against this host

The host's Vision is a real one, and every answer below comes from it: the probe reports the image
each symbol resolved in (`dladdr`), and a name the Vision does not carry is asked for as well, so a
reader can tell an absence from a broken reader. `tools/vision/probe130.m` is the probe, and it is
in the tree so that this is one command a reader can paste rather than one they have to trust.

```
sdk=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
xcrun clang -target arm64-apple-ios15.0-macabi -isysroot "$sdk" \
    -iframework "$sdk/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/Frameworks" -fobjc-arc -w \
    -framework Foundation -framework Vision -framework CoreGraphics \
    -framework CoreImage -framework CoreVideo tools/vision/probe130.m -o probe130 && ./probe130
```

The only change made to the run's output below is the `NSIndexSet` pointer in each `supportedRevisions`
line, which is this host's heap address and carries nothing; it is written `ADDRESS`.

```

Four things are read out of that, and one of them is not read out of it at all.

**`VNElementTypeSize` is 4 for a float, 8 for a double and 0 for everything else**, which is what
`Vision/Vision130.m` answers, with the widths taken as `sizeof` rather than written as literals.

**`+revision:supportsConstellation:` is the truth table above**: revisions 1 to 3 for 65 points,
revision 3 alone for 76, and NO for every other pair including the not-defined constellation and
every revision outside 1 to 3. The port transcribes it; it does not narrow it to the revisions it
carries, because a revision the port cannot run is refused by the request handler with
`VNErrorUnsupportedRevision`, which is a different question from the one this method asks.

**`VNAnimalIdentifierCat` is `Cat` and `VNAnimalIdentifierDog` is `Dog`**, read here straight out of
the constant's own value and matching what section 3 read out of the 16.0 image.

**`VNRequestProgressProviding` is reachable by name** and the nonsense name the probe asks for beside
it is not, so the pair is what makes a "found" here mean something, and `NSProtocolFromString`
answering for the port's own protocol object is a different answer from one the reader would give
anyway. The port does not adopt the protocol on its `VNRecognizeTextRequest`, and says so in that row:
this port cannot run a text recognition, so there is no progress to report, and a `progressHandler`
that is stored and never called would answer the same as none at all.

**The protocol's metadata reaches the image twice, from the same declaration and not from two.** The
build writes one `<Library>Protocols<release>.m` per release a library's implemented protocol rows
arrived in and names every protocol of that release in it, so the row above causes a
`VisionBackportsProtocols13.0.m`; and `Vision130.m`'s own `@implementation VNRecognizeTextRequest`
emits the same protocol object, because the SDK declares that class as conforming to it and reopening
a class emits the protocols it conforms to. Both definitions come out of the one SDK declaration, so
they are the same weak symbol and the runtime keeps one. This is not the trap
`tests/addon/registry_test.lua`'s `protocol_declarations` guards -- that one is about a source
*defining* `@protocol X <...>` with a member list of its own, which would emit a second object whose
contents could disagree with the SDK's, and no source of this library does that.

**The revision counts above are the host's, and they are NOT copied.** This host's Vision is a
generation past 13.0, and its `supportedRevisions` count every revision Apple has added since --
revisions 2 and 3 of the text and capture-quality requests, for instance, arrived in 14.0 and 16.0
and did not exist in 13.0. What 13.0 had is read from the SDK's own per-revision annotations, which
are the same source a row's `introduced` comes from:

| request | revisions declared at 13.0 | later revisions, and when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VNClassifyImageRequest` | 1 | none |
| `VNDetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest` | 1 | 2 at 14.0 |
| `VNDetectHumanRectanglesRequest` | 1 | 2 at 15.0 |
| `VNGenerateAttentionBasedSaliencyImageRequest` | 1 | none |
| `VNGenerateImageFeaturePrintRequest` | 1 | none |
| `VNGenerateObjectnessBasedSaliencyImageRequest` | 1 | none |
| `VNRecognizeAnimalsRequest` | 1 | 2 at 15.0 |
| `VNRecognizeTextRequest` | 1 | 2 at 14.0, 3 at 16.0 |

Every one of them had exactly revision 1 in 13.0, which is what `VNRequests.m`'s own revision table
already answers for a request class it has never heard of -- so no request of this slice needed a
revision of its own to be placed correctly. Copying the host's counts would have put a 16.0 release's
revisions into a 13.0 row, which is the way a modern answer becomes a wrong one.

### 4.1 One class of these will not instantiate here, and nil answers every question

The same probe asks what a fresh instance of each of the observation classes answers for the methods
their own headers declare. Read the `alloc/init` lines FIRST, because they decide what the rest of
the block means:

```
alloc/init VNRecognizedText                   gave an object
alloc/init VNRecognizedTextObservation        gave an object
alloc/init VNFeaturePrintObservation          GAVE NIL
alloc/init VNSaliencyImageObservation         gave an object
alloc/init VNRecognizeTextRequest             gave an object
alloc/init VNNoClassOfThisName (the control)  no class, nil either way

fresh VNRecognizedText boundingBoxForRange:{0,0} = nil, error = none
fresh VNRecognizedText boundingBoxForRange responds: responds
fresh VNRecognizedTextObservation topCandidates:10 = 0 candidates, topCandidates:0 = 0, responds: responds
fresh VNFeaturePrintObservation computeDistance to itself = NO, distance = -1.000000, error = none
fresh VNFeaturePrintObservation elementType = 0 elementCount = 0 data = nil, responds: no selector
VNRecognizedText carries 14 method(s): string requestRevision hash initWithCoder: confidence .cxx_destruct isEqual: copyWithZone: debugDescription encodeWithCoder: boundingBoxForRange:error: crOutput initWithRequestRevision:CRImageReaderOutput: setRequestRevision:
VNRecognizedTextObservation carries 13 method(s): vn_cloneObject hash initWithCoder: .cxx_destruct isEqual: text setText: encodeWithCoder: isTitle setTextObjects: setIsTitle: textObjects topCandidates:
VNFeaturePrintObservation carries 5 method(s): elementType elementCount data computeDistance:toFeaturePrintObservation:error: computeDistanceToFeaturePrintObservation:error:
```

**The three `computeDistance` lines and the `elementType` line are a measurement of nil and are not
measurements of Vision.** `[[VNFeaturePrintObservation alloc] init]` gives nil on this host, so the
call answered `NO`, left the caller's `-1.0f` where it was, and set no error -- which is precisely
what messaging nil does, and what a reader would have written down as Apple's answer if the `alloc/init`
line had not been beside it. It was caught here by asking `respondsToSelector:` on the same object and
being told `no selector` while `class_copyMethodList` on its class listed the method in the same run:
`instancesRespondToSelector:` said yes and the instance said no, and the only thing that reconciles
those two is an object that is not an instance of that class. **The `alloc/init` line is now in the
probe, above the questions, and the control beside it is a name that is no class at all**, so that
this reading cannot be mistaken for an answer again.

What is left of that block is Apple's own, and it is what the port answers:

- **`boundingBoxForRange:error:` on a `VNRecognizedText` with nothing in it is `nil` with no error.**
  The class does instantiate here, so this is Apple's answer and not nil's.
- **`topCandidates:` on a `VNRecognizedTextObservation` with nothing in it is an empty array**, for a
  count of 10 and for a count of 0 alike.
- **`computeDistance:toFeaturePrintObservation:error:` cannot be measured against Apple's own Vision
  on this host at all**, and the reason is the one line above. `-computeDistance` is still defined and
  the port's answer is written down beside the reason (section 7).

The three `carries` lines are the runtime's own method lists, and they are here for two reasons: they
name the selector spellings the runtime holds (`crOutput` and
`computeDistanceToFeaturePrintObservation:error:` on the first and third, neither of which any 13.0
header declares, are this host's own later additions), and `class_copyMethodList` is the measurement
that settled the nil question above. `VNRecognizedTextObservation`'s `text`, `textObjects` and
`isTitle` are likewise 14.0 and 16.0 and are not 13.0.

### 4.2 The three catalogue methods, and the one of them the port can answer

```
knownClassificationsForRevision:1 = 1303 name(s), error = none
    the first is "abacus" and the last is "zucchini"
knownAnimalIdentifiersForRevision:1 = 2 identifier(s), error = none
    they are Cat,Dog
supportedRecognitionLanguagesForTextRecognitionLevel:accurate revision:1 = 1 language(s), error = none
knownClassificationsForRevision:2 = 1303 name(s), error = none
    the first is "abacus" and the last is "zucchini"
knownAnimalIdentifiersForRevision:2 = 2 identifier(s), error = none
    they are Cat,Dog
supportedRecognitionLanguagesForTextRecognitionLevel:accurate revision:2 = 8 language(s), error = none
knownClassificationsForRevision:3 = 0 name(s), error = com.apple.Vision 16
knownAnimalIdentifiersForRevision:3 = 0 identifier(s), error = com.apple.Vision 16
supportedRecognitionLanguagesForTextRecognitionLevel:accurate revision:3 = 33 language(s), error = none
```

Three class methods, each deprecated in 15.0 and each annotated `ios(13.0, 15.0)` in the header, so
all three are 13.0 API. **They are not printed in full** -- the classification catalogue is 1303 names
-- because the count is the whole of what a port that carries no such catalogue can be compared
against, and a reader who wants the names asks Vision for them.

- **`knownAnimalIdentifiersForRevision:` answers `Cat,Dog`, two of two, for every revision it carries.**
  That is the whole of the list and not a narrowing of it, and the port's answer is the two
  identifiers `Vision130.m` exports, whose own values section 3 read out of the 16.0 image. A revision
  it does not carry answers nothing and `com.apple.Vision` **16**, which is `VNErrorUnsupportedRevision`
  and the same code the port's request path already refuses an uncarrried revision with.
- **`knownClassificationsForRevision:` answers 1303 names and `supportedRecognitionLanguages…:` answers
  1, 8 and 33 language codes.** These are catalogues of models this port has not got: there is no
  classifier behind `VNClassifyImageRequest` and no text recogniser behind `VNRecognizeTextRequest`, and
  a list of another release's copied in would be a wrong list rather than a missing one. Section 7 says
  what a caller gets instead.

## 5. What this port does with a request whose work it cannot do

`VNHandlers.m`'s `charon_vision_failure` answers `VNErrorNotImplemented` for every request it cannot
run, and `VNErrorUnsupportedRevision` for a revision the port's own table does not carry. That is
where a request of this slice ends when a handler runs one, and it is why a class row here says the
class is there and answers what a caller can test, rather than that the request works.

## 6. Three defaults a fresh ivar would have got wrong

Opening a class whose SDK header declares a property makes clang synthesise that property's accessors
onto a new ivar, and a new ivar holds zero. That is the right answer for most of what these classes
declare -- `string`, `confidence`, `elementType`, `elementCount`, `data`, `salientObjects`,
`customWords`, `recognitionLevel` (whose `VNRequestTextRecognitionLevelAccurate` is 0),
`minimumTextHeight` (0.0) and `automaticallyDetectsLanguage` (NO) all start at the value their own
headers document -- and it is the wrong answer for three, which `Vision130.m` writes down. **Each of
the three has a row of its own, and the row is where a reader of the property looks:**

| member | row | zero is | what it answers instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VNDetectHumanRectanglesRequest.upperBodyOnly` | `registry/Vision/ios11.json` | NO | **YES**: "the request is setup to detect upper body only" |
| `VNGenerateImageFeaturePrintRequest.imageCropAndScaleOption` | `registry/Vision/ios11.json` | `CenterCrop` | **`ScaleFill`**, which is enumeration value **2** and not 0 |
| `VNRecognizeTextRequest.usesLanguageCorrection` | `registry/Vision/ios11.json` | NO | NO, and the row says why NO is not Apple's default |

The third is the one that is not fixed, and it is left unfixed on purpose: the header that ships in
this SDK says nothing about it, no release this port deploys on can be asked because none of them
carries Vision at all, and nothing here runs a text recognition that would set it. A `YES` written in
from memory would be an unmeasured value; a `NO` the row states out loud, together with the three
things that are known and the one that is not, is at least an honest one. Nothing can observe the
difference either way, because the request cannot be run.

The two that are fixed are now **measured answers** rather than transcriptions: the port's own classes
built under names of their own and read back, which is section 8.

That is also the whole of what the compile for armv7 is good for beyond the warnings: it is what found
the three. A Mac Catalyst build of the same source is silent about all of it.

## 7. The members these classes carry, and why none of them needs a row of its own

`Vision130.m` defines 39 members, and this section names the command that counts them, because a
member count without one is a number a reader cannot check. `.cxx_destruct` is dropped: clang emits one
per class with an ivar and no SDK header declares it.

```

members: 39
```

`OBJECTS` is the armv7 objects folder of a 6.1.3 build of this library, and `tools/vision/armv7-objects.lua`
produces it for one library in the seconds a whole-tree gate build takes minutes -- through
`backports.compile()`, so the flags are the build's own and not a command line of its own:

```
CHARON_ROOT=<checkout> xmake l tools/vision/armv7-objects.lua Vision <objects> 6.1.3
```

**The earlier reading of this section was wrong in both numbers, and it was wrong for the tree it was
written on.** It said 34 members and "every one of them by the row of the class it belongs to". The same
command over the object as it stood at `6328dcde6` -- the commit that wrote the 34 -- reads **35**
members, and three of them are answered by rows of their own, the precision and recall triple of
`VNClassificationObservation`, which are the only three a registry row names in their own right. The
39 is the same object with the four methods of 7.1 below, and 35 + 4 is 39, so the 34 was a
miscount of a real list and not a list that has since changed. `nm -m` and not `nm -gU` is the other
half: a method implementation on a class the port opens is `non-external`, and `nm -gU` on this object
lists 55 symbols of which NONE is a method, so a count taken that way answers a different question.

None of the 39 needs a row of its own, and that is not an assumption -- it is the tree's own reader
asked over the list the command above writes:

```
CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> REGISTRY_ROOT=<worktree>/packages/a/apple-backports \
MEMBERS=<worktree>/Vision130-members.txt xmake l tools/vision/check-rows.lua
```

```
members checked: 39 | answered by a row of their own: 3 | answered by another row: 36 | UNANSWERED: 0
```

`entry_of` in `modules/apple/backports.lua` falls back to the row of the class a member belongs to,
because a class row answers for the members of a class the port defines wholly, and none of these
twelve classes is one a release carries. `check-rows.lua` calls that same function, so the 36 is the
tree's rule and not a copy of it.

The same shape is already in the tree: `VNRequests.o` defines `-[VNDetectRectanglesRequest
initWithCompletionHandler:]` and `-[VNImageBasedRequest initWithCompletionHandler:]`, and neither is a
row, while `VNDetectRectanglesRequest.minimumAspectRatio` and its six siblings are. Both are answered
by the class's own row.

### 7.1 A property is synthesised; a method is not, so every declared method is written down

Opening a class makes clang synthesise every **property** its header declares onto a new ivar, and
nothing at all for a **method**. So every property of these twelve classes is answered without a line
and every method had to be written down: a caller that sends one this object does not define does not
get a wrong answer, it loses the process to an unrecognised selector. **Nine methods are declared by
the 13.0 headers of these twelve classes**, read out of the SDK the package compiles against with

```
for h in VNClassifyImageRequest VNRecognizeAnimalsRequest VNRecognizeTextRequest VNFaceObservationAccepting; do
    awk '/^@interface/,/^@end/' "$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks/Vision.framework/Headers/$h.h" | grep -E '^[-+] \('
done
```

plus the `@interface` blocks of `VNRecognizedText`, `VNRecognizedTextObservation`,
`VNFeaturePrintObservation` and `VNSaliencyImageObservation` in the same SDK's `VNObservation.h` -- and
that last of the four declares no method at all. The nine:

| method | declared at | what this port does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-[VNRecognizedText boundingBoxForRange:error:]` | 13.0 | `nil`, no error -- Apple's own answer for the same class with nothing in it (4.1) |
| `-[VNRecognizedTextObservation topCandidates:]` | 13.0 | an empty array -- Apple's own answer for the same class with nothing in it (4.1) |
| `-[VNFeaturePrintObservation computeDistance:toFeaturePrintObservation:error:]` | 13.0 | `NO`, both out-parameters untouched -- **not measured against Apple**, whose class does not instantiate here (4.1) |
| `+[VNRecognizeAnimalsRequest knownAnimalIdentifiersForRevision:error:]` | 13.0, deprecated 15.0 | the two identifiers this library exports, and a revision the port's table does not carry refused with `VNErrorUnsupportedRevision` (4.2) |
| `+[VNClassifyImageRequest knownClassificationsForRevision:error:]` | 13.0, deprecated 15.0 | **not written down** -- 1303 names (4.2) |
| `+[VNRecognizeAnimalsRequest supportedIdentifiersAndReturnError:]` | 15.0 | not written down, and not 13.0 at all |
| `+[VNRecognizeTextRequest supportedRecognitionLanguagesForTextRecognitionLevel:revision:error:]` | 13.0, deprecated 15.0 | **not written down** -- 1, 8 and 33 language codes (4.2) |
| `+[VNClassifyImageRequest supportedIdentifiersAndReturnError:]` | 15.0 | not written down, and not 13.0 at all |
| `+[VNRecognizeTextRequest supportedRecognitionLanguagesAndReturnError:]` | 15.0 | not written down, and not 13.0 at all |

The three 15.0 rows are listed so that their absence is read as a decision: they are not 13.0 API, and
`introduced` in this registry means what the SDK annotates.

**The three that are left open are left open on purpose, and here is what a caller gets.** Each is a
catalogue method: it reports what a model can recognise, and this port has no model behind
`VNClassifyImageRequest` or `VNRecognizeTextRequest`. A list written in from another release would be
a wrong list -- this host's own catalogue is a generation past 13.0 and its own counts already differ
between revisions, which is exactly what the revision table above warns about -- and a wrong list is
worse than a missing one, because a caller cannot tell the difference between the two and will filter
on identifiers nothing here can produce. So `+knownClassificationsForRevision:error:`,
`+supportedIdentifiersAndReturnError:` and `+supportedRecognitionLanguagesForTextRecognitionLevel:revision:error:`
raise an unrecognised selector on this port, and the port's own probe says so rather than leaving a
reader to infer it:

```
VNClassifyImageRequest             +knownClassificationsForRevision:error:                     answered: no, a caller sending it gets an unrecognised selector
VNRecognizeAnimalsRequest          +supportedIdentifiersAndReturnError:                        answered: no, a caller sending it gets an unrecognised selector
VNRecognizeTextRequest             +supportedRecognitionLanguagesForTextRecognitionLevel:revision:error: answered: no, a caller sending it gets an unrecognised selector
```

Nothing is written to `coordination/crutches.md` for these three, because they are not a workaround
for a cause that can be fixed: the cause is that the recognisers are Apple's own models and no source
for Vision exists at all (`coordination/corpus/sources.md`). This is the honest end for them and the
question only the owner can answer is whether a band should carry a row per missing method so that the
registry says so rather than the facts page.

### 7.2 What release-split says about this library's objects, and what it cannot see

Run over the armv7 objects of the seven Vision sources of a 6.1.3 build, which is the whole library
except the three the build generates:

```
xmake l tools/release-split.lua <objects> <split.tsv>
```

```
CharonVisionBilinear.c.o   0 symbols   (no exported symbol at all: every symbol is internal)
VNConstants.m.o            29          11.0
VNHandlers.m.o              4          11.0
VNObservations.m.o         34          11.0
VNRecognizedObjectObservation.m.o  2   12.0
VNRequests.m.o             34          11.0
Vision110.m.o               2          11.0
Vision130.m.o              25          16.0
release-split: clean, every object file's symbols first-appear in one release (8 files, 130 symbols, 50 releases checked)
```

**The four methods of 7.1 add no exported symbol, and both halves of that are measured.** Compiled
from the same tree with and without them:

```
nm -gU Vision130.m.o | wc -l     55 before   55 after
nm -m  Vision130.m.o, methods     35 before   39 after
xmake l tools/release-split.lua <obj>       25 symbols, all 16.0, before
xmake l tools/release-split.lua <obj>       25 symbols, all 16.0, after
```

They are `non-external`, which is the same reason `nm -gU` sees no method at all in the count above,
and it is why a change to what a port defines can never show up in a release-split count: what that
count certifies here is the twenty-five symbols a caller binds by name -- twelve `_OBJC_CLASS_$_`,
twelve `_OBJC_METACLASS_$_` and `VNElementTypeSize` -- and their first appearance, which is 16.0 for
every one of them: after 12.0 and by 16.0, because the held set has no 13.0, 14.0 or 15.0 in it
(section 2).

**The three generated protocol objects are a blind spot, and it is measured rather than asserted.**
`VNRequestProgressProviding` is the only protocol row of 13.0, and the build writes
`VisionBackportsProtocols13.0.m` for it into `objects/Vision/protocols/`, one folder below the one
release-split walks. Asked for by name:

```
xmake l tools/release-split.lua <objects>/Vision/protocols <out> "$(cat <objects>/sdkdir)"
```

```
release-split: clean, every object file's symbols first-appear in one release (3 files, 0 symbols, 50 releases checked)
```

**Zero symbols.** That is `release-split`'s own `EXCLUDED` table doing what it is written to do --
`__OBJC_PROTOCOL_$_` is on it, because that symbol appears in no release's export surface -- and it
means the tool's "clean" here certifies nothing at all. It is the blind spot the script's own header
warns about, met exactly. The symbol is not a release export by measurement either:

```
python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py _OBJC_PROTOCOL_\$_VNRequestProgressProviding
```

```
_OBJC_PROTOCOL_$_VNRequestProgressProviding	NONE
```

so the exclusion is right and there is no mixed release here to find. What the row needs is not a
symbol but the metadata, and that is measured where it is linked -- `nm -a` on the
`libVisionBackports.dylib` of a 6.1.3 build of this tree:

```
__OBJC_PROTOCOL_$_VNRequestProgressProviding   (d, in __DATA)
__OBJC_$_PROTOCOL_INSTANCE_METHODS_VNRequestProgressProviding
```

and the protocol name itself is one of the strings in the image. `NSProtocolFromString` answering for
it by name is measured in section 4.

## 8. What a caller gets about the conformances, measured on the port's own classes

A class whose SDK header names a protocol is put in that protocol's conformance list **by the
declaration alone**. Nothing has to adopt it: declaring `@implementation VNRecognizeTextRequest` was
enough, and no adoption appears anywhere in this library. So `-conformsToProtocol:` and
`-instancesRespondToSelector:` answer for the protocol whether or not this port wants it to, and the
members it declares have to exist or the class answers YES and then raises.

Three of the twelve were in that position. The port's classes are built here under names of their own,
so an answer cannot come from the Vision of this host, and a name that is no class at all is asked for
as the control:

```
xcrun clang -target arm64-apple-ios15.0-macabi -isysroot "$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)" \
    -iframework "$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/Frameworks" \
    -fobjc-arc -w -include rename.h -I packages/a/apple-backports/Vision \
    -framework Foundation -framework Vision -framework CoreGraphics -framework CoreImage \
    -framework CoreVideo -framework CoreML -framework ImageIO \
    tools/vision/conforms130.m packages/a/apple-backports/Vision/*.c \
    packages/a/apple-backports/Vision/*.m -o conforms130 && ./conforms130
```

`rename.h` is the header `tests/backports/host/vision/run.sh` writes from
`registry/Vision/ios11.json`; the whole recipe is in the probe's own first comment.

```
CharonVNDetectFaceCaptureQualityRequest        conforms130            conforms:  VNFaceObservationAccepting  NSCopying
CharonVNRecognizeTextRequest                   conforms130            conforms:  VNRequestProgressProviding  NSCopying
CharonVNRecognizedText                         conforms130            conforms:  VNRequestRevisionProviding  NSSecureCoding  NSCopying
CharonVNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest             conforms130            conforms:  VNFaceObservationAccepting  NSCopying
VNNoClassOfThisName (the control)              nil class              conforms to nothing: no

VNRecognizeTextRequest progressHandler responds: responds, indeterminate = NO, usesLanguageCorrection = NO
VNRecognizedText supportsSecureCoding = YES, string = nil, confidence = 0.000000, requestRevision = 0
VNDetectHumanRectanglesRequest upperBodyOnly = YES
VNGenerateImageFeaturePrintRequest imageCropAndScaleOption = 2 (ScaleFill is 2, CenterCrop is 0)
```

Every answer says `conforms130`, which is the probe's own binary and not `Vision`, and the control
row is a `nil` class that conforms to nothing. Three things come out of it:

- **`VNRecognizeTextRequest` conforms to `VNRequestProgressProviding`, and its two members answer.**
  `progressHandler` responds and `indeterminate` is `NO` -- the same `NO` this host's own Vision
  answers for the class, which is section 4's measurement. The handler is never called, because the
  request cannot be run here. Two registry rows used to say the port does not adopt the protocol on
  this class; it did not adopt it, and it does not have to, because the header already conforms it.
  Both rows now say what the probe measured.
- **The two defaults of section 6 are answers, not transcriptions**: `upperBodyOnly` reads `YES` and
  `imageCropAndScaleOption` reads `2`.
- **`VNRecognizedText` conforms to three protocols** and answers all of them: `supportsSecureCoding`
  is `YES`, and `string`, `confidence` and `requestRevision` read nil, 0 and 0 because nothing of
  this port makes one.

## 9. Why registry-coherence.py could not judge three of these rows, and it is not their length

`coordination/registry-coherence.py` reported, twice, `no sample answered for` the three rows this
band added rather than flipped:

```
FAIL  registry coherence: no sample answered for VNDetectHumanRectanglesRequest.upperBodyOnly
FAIL  registry coherence: no sample answered for VNGenerateImageFeaturePrintRequest.imageCropAndScaleOption
FAIL  registry coherence: no sample answered for VNRecognizeTextRequest.usesLanguageCorrection
```

It is not the length of those rows, and the earlier theory that it was -- that a long row crowds out
the ones around it -- is wrong and was retracted in the commit that shortened them. Asking the tool's
own two functions over the same range is what settles it:

```
python3 - <<'PY'
import importlib.util, os
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("rc", os.path.expanduser("~/Git/projects/ios/coordination/registry-coherence.py"))
rc = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); spec.loader.exec_module(rc)
rows = rc.changed_rows(".", BASE, "HEAD")
prompt = rc.build_prompt(rows, rc.definitions(".", BASE, "HEAD"))
print([a["api"] for _, b, a in rows if b is None and a["api"] not in prompt])
PY
```

```
collected: 42 | new at the tip: 22 | removed: 19 | flipped: 1
  flipped   1 rows,  0 of their apis absent from the prompt
  NEW      22 rows,  3 of their apis absent from the prompt
      absent: VNDetectHumanRectanglesRequest.upperBodyOnly
      absent: VNGenerateImageFeaturePrintRequest.imageCropAndScaleOption
      absent: VNRecognizeTextRequest.usesLanguageCorrection
```

**22 new rows, and 19 of their api strings are in the prompt anyway.** Those 19 are in it as
`REMOVED by this patch` lines -- `changed_rows` also collects the 19 rows this band took out of
`absent_Vision.json`, and `build_prompt` prints a removal's api. The three that are absent are the
three this band *added*, and the cause is in `build_prompt`:

```python
if before is None or isinstance(before, str):
    parts.append(f"  {path}: file is {'added' if before is None else 'unreadable at the base'}")
    continue
```

`before is None` is meant to mean *this file did not exist at the base*. `changed_rows` also produces
it for *this row did not exist at the base*, and the two are not told apart, so every row a patch adds
is answered with `ios11.json: file is added` -- printed 22 times, once per added row -- and the row's
own fields never reach the model. The tool then reports the consequence as its own failure, which is
the right thing to do and the wrong reason to report it: the rows are not unanswerable, they are
unasked.

The 40-row cap fails on the same range for a related reason: it counts 42, of which 19 are removals,
and a removal has no fields that can disagree with anything. The rows a reviewer would actually be
shown are the 22 added and 1 flipped, which is 23.

Both are in `coordination/`, which is not this band's to change. What the band can do is state them
where the next reader of its rows will find them, which is here.

## 10. The fifteen unavailable initializers, and why the header was not the reason

Fifteen rows of `registry/Vision/ios11.json` name an initializer: `-[VNCoreMLModel init]`,
`-[VNCoreMLRequest init]`, `-[VNCoreMLRequest initWithCompletionHandler:]`, `-[VNFaceLandmarkRegion init]`,
`+[VNFaceLandmarkRegion new]`, `-[VNFaceLandmarks init]`, `-[VNImageRequestHandler init]`, and `init` /
`initWithCompletionHandler:` on `VNTargetedImageRequest`, `VNTrackObjectRequest`, `VNTrackRectangleRequest`
and `VNTrackingRequest`. Every one of them said the same thing, and the thing it said was wrong:

```
"reason": "the header marks the initializer unavailable, so a program written for the release does not send it"
"source": "Vision of iOS 16.4, marked unavailable in the header"
```

**The header does mark all fifteen unavailable, and that is not the claim's problem.** The SDK surface
this registry was read from carries it, `unavailable=yes` on all fifteen with `introduced=11.0`:

```
python3 - <<'PY'
import csv
want = ["+[VNFaceLandmarkRegion new]", "-[VNCoreMLModel init]", "-[VNCoreMLRequest initWithCompletionHandler:]",
        "-[VNCoreMLRequest init]", "-[VNFaceLandmarkRegion init]", "-[VNFaceLandmarks init]",
        "-[VNImageRequestHandler init]", "-[VNTargetedImageRequest initWithCompletionHandler:]",
        "-[VNTargetedImageRequest init]", "-[VNTrackObjectRequest initWithCompletionHandler:]",
        "-[VNTrackObjectRequest init]", "-[VNTrackRectangleRequest initWithCompletionHandler:]",
        "-[VNTrackRectangleRequest init]", "-[VNTrackingRequest initWithCompletionHandler:]",
        "-[VNTrackingRequest init]"]
rows = {r["api"]: r for r in csv.DictReader(open("coordination/corpus/sdk-26.2-surface.tsv"), delimiter="\t")
        if r["framework"] == "Vision"}
for api in want:
    print(api, rows[api]["introduced"], repr(rows[api]["unavailable"]))
PY
```

```
+[VNFaceLandmarkRegion new]                             11.0 'yes'

-[VNTrackingRequest init]                               11.0 'yes'
```

`NS_UNAVAILABLE` is a promise about **source**, not about the runtime: it means a program compiled against
that header cannot send the message, and it says nothing about what the class answers when a message
arrives by some other route. A row that rests on it is answering the wrong question, and this host settles
what the wrong answer looks like -- its own Vision is a generation past 11.0 and answers all of them:

The same fifteen, asked of the **host's** Vision, from the second half of the same run:

```
VNNoClassOfThisName (the control) = nil class
VNCoreMLModel              init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNCoreMLRequest            init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNCoreMLRequest            initWithCompletionHandler:         host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNFaceLandmarkRegion       init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNFaceLandmarks            init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNImageRequestHandler      init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNTargetedImageRequest     init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNTargetedImageRequest     initWithCompletionHandler:         host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNTrackObjectRequest       init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNTrackObjectRequest       initWithCompletionHandler:         host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNTrackRectangleRequest    init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNTrackRectangleRequest    initWithCompletionHandler:         host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNTrackingRequest          init                               host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNTrackingRequest          initWithCompletionHandler:         host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
VNFaceLandmarkRegion       new                                host responds=YES defined-by=inherited from=Vision
```

**All fifteen answer on the host, and Apple's own classes inherit every one of them just as the port's
do** -- `defined-by=inherited` on all fifteen, from the `Vision` image. So the header is not what makes
these rows `absent`, and the rows that said so were carrying a reason a measurement contradicts. What makes them absent is section 1: neither
release this port deploys on carries a Vision at all, so nothing either of them has answers the name. That
is the claim, and it is the one `backports.lua` checks -- `carried_by_release` at :1627 asks the band's own
inventory, and the census answers it with a control in the same run.

### What a caller gets instead, measured on the port's own classes

`tools/vision/vn-init-answer.m` compiles this library's classes under names of their own and asks each of
the fifteen what it answers and **which class writes the body**. The two questions are separate and the
difference is the whole of the row: `class_getInstanceMethod` walks the superclass chain and answers YES
for an inherited selector, while `class_copyMethodList` returns a class's own methods only. Asking the
chain for the owner instead answers the leaf every time, and every inherited initializer then looks like
the subclass's own -- a probe that made that mistake printed all fifteen as `defined-by=Charon<Class>` and
was wrong about all fifteen. `class_copyMethodList` is what the row rests on.

The port's classes are the ones being asked, so no answer can come from the Vision of this host:

```
sdk=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)
xcrun clang -target arm64-apple-ios15.0-macabi -isysroot "$sdk" \
    -iframework "$sdk/System/iOSSupport/System/Library/Frameworks" -fobjc-arc -w \
    -include rename.h -I packages/a/apple-backports/Vision \
    -framework Foundation -framework Vision -framework CoreGraphics -framework CoreImage \
    -framework CoreVideo -framework CoreML -framework ImageIO \
    tools/vision/vn-init-answer.m packages/a/apple-backports/Vision/*.c \
    packages/a/apple-backports/Vision/*.m -o vninit && ./vninit
```

`rename.h` is the header `tests/backports/host/vision/run.sh` writes from `registry/Vision/ios11.json`, and
the probe's first comment carries the exact `python3` that writes it, so the run is one paste rather than
something a reader has to reconstruct.

The `from=` column of the run reads `vninit` on all fifteen, which is `dladdr` naming this probe's own
binary: the answer is the port's and not this host's Vision. The `from=Vision` in the host table below is
the same column for the unprefixed names.

```

```

The control class is a `nil class`, so the `responds=YES` beside it is the reader seeing a class.

Three things fall out of that table, and none of them is "the class has no initializer":

- **Not one of the fifteen is written by the class its row names.** Every `init` on a request class is
  `VNRequest`'s (`VNRequests.m`, whose `-init` forwards to `-initWithCompletionHandler:` with a nil
  handler), and every `initWithCompletionHandler:` is `VNImageBasedRequest`'s, which forwards to `[super
  initWithCompletionHandler:]`. `init` and `new` on the three non-request classes -- `VNCoreMLModel`,
  `VNFaceLandmarkRegion`, `VNFaceLandmarks` -- and on `VNImageRequestHandler` are `NSObject`'s.
- **So the method is reachable, and it is reachable as inherited.** `responds=YES` on all fifteen. A caller
  sending `-[VNTrackingRequest init]` gets `VNRequest`'s, which sets the completion handler to nil and the
  revision to the class's default -- a usable request object, not a crash and not a nil.
- **Which is why these rows are `absent` rather than `inert`.** `inert` is "the symbol loads and nothing
  applies it"; nothing here needs applying, because the message a caller sends is answered by a class the
  port defines and exports. The rows are `absent` because neither release the band deploys on has any Vision
  to inherit from in the first place, and the port supplies the classes these selectors would have belonged
  to. That is a fact about the two rungs, and section 1's census carries it with its control.

The rows keep `minimum: 6.0` whatever status they carry. `minimums()` at :2014 reads `entry.minimum` and
never `entry.status`, so each of the fifteen is the placement record for every band below 11.0 and is
load-bearing even where it says the port has no such API.
