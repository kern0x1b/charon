# The twenty-six C API rows the corpus listed as absent, decided against the engine this port actually has

The corpus listed twenty-six rows of JavaScriptCore's C API as absent, every one of them with the same
reason: *the function arrived in iOS N, and nothing in iOS 6 has what it names*. That reason is a
statement about the release's export table, and for these twenty-six it is true and useless at the same
time. The port does not have to answer from the export table. It answers from the engine the release
already carries, and that engine is a whole JavaScriptCore: 885 symbols attributed to the framework in
`coordination/corpus/caches/6.0.tsv`, the ES5 C API end to end - `JSGlobalContextCreate`,
`JSEvaluateScript`, `JSValueToStringCopy`, `JSObjectGetProperty`, `JSClassCreate`, `JSValueIsObjectOfClass` -
and, under them, the engine itself, which evaluates JavaScript. So the question each of the twenty-six
has to answer is not *is the function in the release's table* but **what does the release's engine do
that this function would report, and can the port report it without inventing anything**.

The distinction is the whole family. Twenty-six rows read "absent" is the right answer for most of a
framework that a release does not carry at all. It is the wrong answer for a framework the release
carries in full and whose later API is mostly a matter of asking the engine a question the engine can
answer. Twelve of the twenty-six are such a question; thirteen name a capability the release's engine has
no value for, and stay absent with the capability named; one cannot be answered in either direction and
says so.

Where each group is decided, so that this page can be read against the tree at any revision and found to
match it: the thirteen are in `registry/JavaScriptCore/absent_JavaScriptCore.json`, the twelve in
`registry/JavaScriptCore/capi.json` - eight `implemented`, four `inert`. **This page was first written by
the commit "Name the value JavaScriptCore's thirteen typed-array rows would report on", and at that
revision every one of the twenty-six rows read `absent`**: the other twelve did not exist yet. They are
carried by "Answer the twelve JavaScriptCore C API rows the release's own engine can answer", and the
sentence this paragraph used to hold - that the twelve "are carried" - was written one commit too early,
which is the way this page goes wrong: a claim about work that is not in the range reads as measured. The
number each group has is the number its registry file holds, and the two files are the whole of it.

Those two commits are named by their subjects and not by their hashes, and the reason is worth keeping
beside them. A hash of a commit that is not on main resolves to nothing for a reader of the merged tree -
and it stops resolving even for the band that wrote it, because a rebase rewrites every hash in the series:
this page named both of these by hash, the series was rebased onto a main that had moved, and the two
names were left pointing at objects no branch held. A subject survives that, and a subject is what a reader
goes looking for.

## The engine the release carries, and what it can be asked

`~/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7` carries `JavaScriptCore.framework` in
`/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks` - the path Apple moved to `/System/Library/Frameworks` exactly at
iOS 7.0, the one framework of this package's 21 whose path differs across the covered range, and the
reason `modules/apple/backports.lua`'s `framework_install_path` exists. The image is the 2012 engine.
It is not a stub and it is not inert: `facts/JavaScriptCore/JSContext.md` carries the same checks.m
answering 151 of 151 on an iPad 2 running 6.1.3, over that engine, including a script that throws
(`tests/backports/host/jscontext/checks.m:378` - `Promise` misuse throws a TypeError on the port's
engine too, because the port's Promise is a script the 2012 engine runs), and a `JSContext` whose
`exceptionHandler` receives the thrown value and whose `exception` is then set.

So the port's `JSContext` row answers *there is a JavaScriptCore here* truthfully, and the family below
is built on that answer rather than beside it.

Three measurements of what the engine can hold, all from the release's own files, no device involved:

| question | how | answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| does the C API have a typed-array entry point? | `tools/cache-index/first-rung.py`, the oldest held rung carrying each name, over the 50 held rungs | 10.0.1 for all thirteen of `JSObjectMakeTypedArray*`, `JSObjectGetTypedArray*`, `JSObjectGetArrayBuffer*`, `JSObjectMakeArrayBufferWithBytesNoCopy` and `JSValueGetTypedArrayType` |
| does the engine have the classes? | the 6.1.3 armv7 cache's own symbol table, read by the same `names.lua` the index is built from | 300 `JSC::` symbols; `JSC::JSArray` (7) and `JSC::JSString` (2) are among them; `JSC::JSArrayBuffer`, `JSC::JSTypedArray`, `JSC::Symbol` and `JSC::Promise` are **0** |
| is the class count a real control? | same search, same file | `JSC::JSArray` and `JSC::JSString` are found, so a search that cannot see a JSC class is not what produced the four zeroes |
| is any of the twenty-six in the release's own file? | the same 6.1.3 armv7 index, name by name, 568 892 names read from a 244 881 694-byte cache whose header names its own mtime and size | **0 of 26**, with **9 of 9** of the release's own C API found by the same read (`_JSEvaluateScript`, `_JSGlobalContextCreate`, `_JSValueToStringCopy`, `_JSObjectGetProperty`, `_JSObjectSetProperty`, `_JSObjectHasProperty`, `_JSObjectDeleteProperty`, `_JSClassCreate`, `_JSWeakObjectMapCreate`), so the zero is the twenty-six and not the read |

## The thirteen that name a value the engine cannot hold: absent

`JSObjectGetArrayBufferByteLength()`, `JSObjectGetArrayBufferBytesPtr()`, `JSObjectGetTypedArrayBuffer()`,
`JSObjectGetTypedArrayByteLength()`, `JSObjectGetTypedArrayByteOffset()`, `JSObjectGetTypedArrayBytesPtr()`,
`JSObjectGetTypedArrayLength()`, `JSObjectMakeArrayBufferWithBytesNoCopy()`,
`JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithArrayBufferAndOffset()`, `JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithArrayBuffer()`,
`JSObjectMakeTypedArrayWithBytesNoCopy()`, `JSObjectMakeTypedArray()`, `JSValueGetTypedArrayType()`.

Every one of the thirteen exists to report on, or to make, a value of a kind only an ES6 engine has. The
release's engine has none: not one `JSC::JSArrayBuffer` and not one `JSC::JSTypedArray` among the 300
`JSC::` symbols its own cache carries, and no C entry point that could make one before 10.0.1.

The tempting move is the obvious one, and it is the wrong one. Nine of the thirteen are getters, and
Apple's own answer for a value that is not a typed array is a zero, a null or `kJSTypedArrayTypeNone` -
so a port that returned those unconditionally would link, would not crash, and would be indistinguishable
from correct to any client that never holds a typed array. It would also be a lie to the one client that
does: a caller asking a typed array for its buffer on an engine where the array was made by something
else - a shim, a polyfill, a typed array from a newer context - would be told 0 by a function that has
not looked. `absent` is the honest end, and its effect says what a client actually sees: a weak reference
that is NULL, and no value to ask about.

Carrying them is not a wrapper's work either. A typed array on the release would have to be a value the
2012 engine knows how to make, index and hand to script, and nothing in this package makes engine values.
The workspace does have a JavaScriptCore that has them: `revenant-webkit` builds WebKit 254 with its own
JSC for armv7, where `_JSValueMakeSymbol` and `_JSObjectMakeDeferredPromise` are `T` (defined) symbols.
But both of its `JavaScriptCore.framework` targets declare the *system* framework's install name
(`otool -D` on `build/system/...` and `build/prefixed/...` both answer
`/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/JavaScriptCore`), the engine lives in the dyld shared
cache and cannot be replaced for one process, and bringing it in costs a loader tweak, `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH`,
`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` and a re-exec. That is an environment substitution, not a backport, and it changes
the WebKit an application gets as well. `coordination/FLEET.md` carries the measurement and the reasoning
("neither a wall nor a layout question: replacing the engine whole"); this file does not repeat it.

## The row that can be answered in neither direction: `JSValueMakeSymbol()`

`JSValueMakeSymbol(ctx, description)` returns a unique value of the symbol type. There is no such value
on this release: `JSC::Symbol` is 0 among the 300 `JSC::` symbols, and no held release before 16.0 exports
the function. It is `absent`, and the row beside it, `JSValueIsSymbol()`, is carried - see below - so a
client has a way to *find out* that a value is not a symbol before it tries to make one.

The same sentence is what `facts/JavaScriptCore/JSContext.md` already carries for the Objective-C row
`+[JSValue valueWithNewSymbolFromDescription:inContext:]`: the context is told a TypeError and the answer
is undefined, rather than a string or an object standing in for a symbol, because a string standing in
for a symbol is a different value that claims to be the same one.
## The eight the release's engine can answer, carried

`registry/JavaScriptCore/capi.json` holds the twelve rows this section is about; the eight that answer
something are built in `JavaScriptCore/JSCAPI.m` and the one that returns a promise is built with the
promise it returns, in `JavaScript.m`'s own file (`JSValue.m`, `DeferredPromise`). Each is asked
directly by `tests/backports/host/jscontext/checks.m`, which is a differential: the same file runs
first against the host's own JavaScriptCore, which is the oracle, then against the backport linked over
the host's C API. **Both sides answer 177 of 177**, and the blocks-and-structs matrix is 351 lines
identical on the two.

| row | what it answers | what it is built on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JSValueIsArray()` | whether a value is an array by class | `charon_js_is_array`, the helper `-isArray` already answers through |
| `JSValueIsDate()` | whether a value is a Date by class | `charon_js_is_date`, likewise |
| `JSValueIsSymbol()` | false, for every value of an engine with no symbols | the measurement above |
| `JSObjectGetPropertyForKey()` | reads the property a value key names | `JSValueToStringCopy` for the key, the release's own `JSObjectGetProperty` for the read |
| `JSObjectSetPropertyForKey()` | writes it | the release's own `JSObjectSetProperty` |
| `JSObjectHasPropertyForKey()` | whether it is there | the release's own `JSObjectHasProperty` |
| `JSObjectDeletePropertyForKey()` | removes it, and answers true for a property that is not there (ES5 8.12.9) | the release's own `JSObjectDeleteProperty` |
| `JSObjectMakeDeferredPromise()` | a promise and the two functions that settle it | the port's own ES5 promise, the same one `+[JSValue valueWithNewPromiseInContext:fromExecutor:]` hands out |

ToPropertyKey, which the four `ForKey` rows are named for, is ToString for every value this engine can
hold: a string key is itself, a number key is its own string (so it indexes an array), a boolean key is
`"true"`, and an object key runs its own `toString` and can throw - in which case the exception is the
answer, the call answers NULL or false, and nothing is read, written or deleted. A key of the *symbol*
type is the one answer ToPropertyKey gives that ToString does not, and it cannot arise.

### What the two engines answer differently, and what is only measured

- **The attributes of a set are kept by neither engine.** `JSObjectSetPropertyForKey` with
  `kJSPropertyAttributeReadOnly` leaves the property writable on the host's engine and on this one: the
  release's engine keeps no attribute on an object it lays out itself, which `JSValue.m` already names
  from the iPad 2, and the host's own does not either, measured in the same run. So the row promises no
  attribute rather than promising one that arrives.
- **A reaction runs on the next run loop turn here and as the call returns there.** A promise the C API
  resolves runs its reaction on the next run loop turn of the port, because the port's job queue has no
  leave of its own to run at when a C client makes the call itself - the same sentence
  `+[JSValue valueWithNewPromiseInContext:fromExecutor:]` carries. The host drains its microtask queue as
  the outermost call into script returns.
- **A rejection through the C API leaves its reaction unrun, on both engines.** Measured in the same run
  and asserted on neither: a promise, a `then`, a `reject` answered with a value and no exception, and
  the reason still unread after a script entry and a run loop turn - the host's own engine exactly as
  the backport does. The port's own promise does carry a rejection to a reaction when one is made from
  Objective-C (`checks.m`'s `CheckPromises`, which passes on both sides); this is the arrangement
  neither engine runs, and asserting the host's answer would be asserting a measurement.
- **The exception out-parameter the SDK's signature of three of the four property functions carries** is
  passed straight through, so a getter or setter that throws leaves it where the caller reads it. Every
  other call of these four in this package already passes the SDK's arity with NULL there -
  `JSValue.m`'s `NamedProperty`, every property read of `JSExportBridge.m` - and answers correctly on a
  6.1.3 device (`facts/JavaScriptCore/JSContext.md`, 151 of 151 on an iPad 2), so a release whose own
  function takes no such argument is reading none of it.

## The four that are carried inert

`JSGlobalContextSetName`, `JSGlobalContextCopyName`, `JSGlobalContextSetInspectable` and
`JSGlobalContextIsInspectable` are a Web Inspector's two fields for a context: the name it lists the
context under, and whether it may attach. This port carries no Web Inspector - no protocol here that
could be attached - so nothing on it reads either. They are carried rather than absent because the
answer this port can give is the answer a release with no inspector gives, and a client that weak-links
the symbol is answered instead of left to call through NULL; each says so once in the log the first time
an application reaches it, which is what an inert row is.

They are **not bridged** to `-[JSContext setName:]` and `-[JSContext setInspectable:]`, which keep their
own value in the wrapper, and that is stated rather than left to be found. The wrapper registry holds
its values weakly by design, so a store a C client could reach would have to outlive the wrapper and die
with the context; the only such store the release has is a `JSWeakObjectMap`, and it holds JavaScript
values rather than a name. The two APIs were measured not to agree on the host either: Apple's
`JSGlobalContextSetName` writes the global object's own `name()` (JSContextRef.cpp:241), which is the
inspector's field, and not the wrapper's.

Two of the four cannot be compared with a host at all: `JSGlobalContextSetInspectable` and
`JSGlobalContextIsInspectable` are `API_AVAILABLE(macos(NA))` in the SDK, so macOS's own JavaScriptCore
does not carry them and no oracle for them exists on this machine. Their contract is the header's own
round trip - a flag read back what was set - and neither the fact nor the effect claims more than that.

## Which release each object is, and which release each name was published in

**`JSCAPI.m` is one release: iOS 6.1.3, by construction.** Every entry point it defines is absent from
6.1.3 - that is the whole reason the file exists - so no band this package builds can supply any of them
from the release, and the object is 6.1.3-band surface by that fact rather than by its name. The file
carries no release suffix for the same reason `UIKit26_*` needs none: each of those is one object per
release because each *replaces* a class a later release has, and here every symbol is new to the band.

Its eleven functions are nevertheless the API of four Apple releases, and the `introduced` field of each
row records where Apple published that name: `JSGlobalContextSetName` and `CopyName` at 8.0, `JSValueIsArray`
and `JSValueIsDate` at 9.0, the four `ForKey` rows and `JSValueIsSymbol` at 13.0, and the two
`JSGlobalContext…Inspectable` at 16.4. Those four numbers are a fact about Apple's headers, not a claim
about which band the object belongs to, and nothing in the release-split check reads them. The twelfth
symbol, `JSObjectMakeDeferredPromise` (13.0), is defined in `JSValue.m` rather than beside its eleven
because it returns the promise that file builds; moving it out would mean calling across files into a
function whose own exports a band's release already has, which is the trap `charon/AGENTS.md` names.

Every one of the twenty-six rows is `minimum: 6.0`, and the two objects are one release each: `JSCAPI.m`
exports eight symbols the release has none of and `JSValue.m` the ninth beside the promise it returns, so
neither file is claimed from a band that already carries its exports. The four `ForKey` rows are four names
of one release (iOS 13.0) and the thirteen typed-array rows thirteen names of another (10.0), and a protocol
conformance is not a split - nothing here conforms to a protocol.
