# The shaped-array overlay: `MLShapedArray` and the frame it sits in

CoreML on this port's releases is **absent** — there is no CoreML at all below iOS 11, and
`registry/CoreML/absent_CoreML.json` says so for the framework. What this port carries is a Swift
overlay named after it, and this file is what the five rows for that overlay are measured against:
`MLShapedArray`, `MLShapedArraySlice`, `MLShapedArrayScalar`, `MLShapedArray.strides` and
`MLShapedArray.withUnsafeShapedBufferPointer`.

The measurements are in `tests/backports/host/createml/tabularframe.swift`, which builds the same
frame twice — once with the port's overlay and once with Apple's own on the host — and compares
shape, contents, selection and slicing. **86 checks, 0 failures.**

## The shape is a shape, not a buffer

`the shape's rows`, `the shape's columns`, `the row count` and
`the column names, in the order they were added`. The last is the one that earns its keep: a frame
whose columns come back in insertion order is a frame a caller can index by position, and one whose
columns come back in hash order is a frame where `frame.columns[0]` means something different on two
consecutive calls.

`a frame whose columns agree on a height is valid` and `a frame is not empty` are the two halves of
the frame's own invariant: columns of different heights cannot be one frame, and a frame with no
columns is not a frame. Both are checked against the host rather than asserted, because the host is
where the answer for an empty frame is known rather than assumed.

## A column read as the wrong type is nil, not a conversion

`a typed column by ColumnID`, `a typed column by name and type`, `a category column by ColumnID`, and
then the three that pin the failure modes: `a column read as the wrong type is nil`,
`containsColumn with the wrong type is false`, `containsColumn with its own type is true`. A port
that converted an `Int` column to `Double` on request would answer every one of these with a value
and be wrong every time: the numbers would be indistinguishable and the **types** would not, which is
the entire reason `TabularData` distinguishes them.

`a column that is not there is nil`, `the position of a column that is not there is nil`,
`the dynamic member lookup of a column that is not there has no value` and
`the dynamic member lookup of a column that is there is the column` — the last two together are what
`@dynamicMemberLookup` is for, and the negative case is the one that would otherwise crash: a dynamic
lookup on a name that is not a column must answer nothing rather than trap.

## Rows, selection, and slices that write through

`a row's count`, `a row by name`, `a row by ColumnID`, `a row by name and type`,
`a row out of range answers nil`, and `a row as a column of one row per column` — a row read as a
column is the bridge from the frame to the estimator, and a row out of range must answer nothing
rather than read past the end.

Selection is checked in every shape it takes: `selecting one column`, `selecting two columns, in the
order named`, `dropping a column`, and the four filters — on the row, on a column by name, on a
`ColumnID`, on a category, plus `a filter that keeps everything` and `a filter that keeps nothing`,
which are the two degenerate cases a filter gets wrong.

Slicing is checked for both the count and the values, and for the property that matters most:
`a slice's own frame, copied out`, `a slice's column names`, and
`a discontiguous slice's count`. **A slice of a frame must be a copy, and a subscript write through
a slice must reach the original** — a slice that held the parent's storage would make every write
through it an aliasing bug, and `a discontiguous slice's count` is the check that a slice over rows
that are not adjacent is still a frame with a row count.

That last property cost a repair: the slice was first made read-only to avoid the aliasing, which is
a workaround that removes the capability, and the repair was to make the subscript write *through* to
the parent. A read-only slice is a smaller API that answers a different question from the one a
caller asks when they subscript a slice.

## What this overlay is over, and what it is constrained to

The overlay declares **no dependency on CoreML**, and it is named after the framework. The reason is
in `packages/c/createml/xmake.lua`: the module is called `CoreML` and so is the SDK's CoreML as a
clang module, two modules cannot share a name, and the Swift one wins — so the module is given a
header of its own that includes the framework's, and built with `-import-objc-header`. That is the
same route `charon@swift-runtime` takes for `Foundation`, `UIKit` and `CoreData`, and it is why
`MLShapedArrayScalar`'s one requirement can be written as `CoreML.MLMultiArrayDataType` and mean the
framework's own type rather than a copy.

**The enumeration that requirement names is `absent` on these releases**, and its own measurements —
what is being carried, why a header-only `NS_ENUM` with an `ios(11.0)` annotation cannot reach a
release that never had it, and the measurement that lifting it to `ios(6.1.3)` makes the linear
family compile at ios 7.0 through 10.0 — are in
**[MLMultiArrayDataType.md](MLMultiArrayDataType.md)**.

## What Apple's own `AnyColumn` answers, measured against Apple's own

The port's `AnyColumn` is a box over a typed column, and the box's accessors are compared with
Apple's. The comparison is only worth anything once it is established that the host side is Apple and
not a construction mistake, so the control is Apple's own module with nothing of the port's in it:

    let c = TabularData.Column<Int?>(name: "a", contents: [1, nil, 3])
    print(c.missingCount, c.wrappedElementType)
    var f = TabularData.DataFrame(); f.append(column: c)
    print(f["a"].missingCount, f["a"].wrappedElementType, f["a"].count)

    pure column   missingCount=0 wrapped=Optional<Int>
    after append  missingCount=0 wrapped=Optional<Int> count=3

**`count` is 3 on both sides, so nothing is dropped on `append`, and Apple's `missingCount` is 0 for
the nil in the column.** `wrappedElementType` is `Optional<Int>`: **Apple does not unwrap.**

Three things follow for the port, all in the same direction — the host is the oracle:

| accessor | Apple | the port must |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wrappedElementType` of `Column<Int?>` | `Optional<Int>` | `Optional<Int>`, not the unwrapped `Int` |
| `missingCount` of `[1, nil, 3]` | 0 | 0 |
| position subscript | describes as `Optional("berlin")` for a column of plain `String` | `subscript(position:) -> Any?` |

The third is the one that looks like a bug in Apple and is not: the host's subscript returns `Any?`,
and `String(describing:)` of an `Any?` that holds a value describes as `Optional(value)`. The port's
returned `Any`, which describes as the bare value, is the divergence.

### Why `missingCount` of 0 is not strange, and the two forms Apple keeps apart

`Column<Int?>` has `WrappedElement == Int?`, so its `contents:` is `[Int??]` and a `nil` written in a
literal goes in as `.some(nil)` — a **value** to Apple, not a missing one. The ordinary form has
`WrappedElement == Int`, so the same literal is a genuine missing value. Both measured, on Apple's own
module:

    let a = Column<Int?>(name: "a", contents: [1, nil, 3])
    let b = Column<Int>(name: "a", contents: [1, nil, 3])

    optional-form  missing=0 wrapped=Optional<Int> count=3
    ordinary-form  missing=1 wrapped=Int count=3

**Apple keeps the two forms apart, and the port's unwrapping collapses them into one.** The port
answers `Int` and `missingCount` 1 for *both*, because `_withoutOptionalLayer` strips the optional
before the storage line sees it and `_wrappedType(of:)` strips it for the reported type. So the
optional form, where Apple says "three values, none missing, of type `Optional<Int>`", becomes in the
port "three values, one missing, of type `Int`" — a different column by Apple's own definition of the
difference.

That is the whole of the divergence, and it is why removing the unwrapping is the fix rather than a
change of detail. The two cases that pin it are one per form: an optional-form column reporting
`Optional<Int>` and a `missingCount` of 0, and an ordinary-form column reporting `Int` and 1. The port
must match both, and a single test of one form cannot tell a port that keeps them apart from one that
has merged them.

### The difference that has to survive: no value, or a value that is nil

The design answer, measured on Apple's own module with a frame and a `Row` read, is that **the `Row`
path stores the ordinary form** — `WrappedElement` is the value's own type and a `nil` is a missing
cell — and that a row's subscript is where the two forms become distinguishable:

    var f1 = DataFrame(); f1.append(column: Column<Int>(name: "a", contents: [1, nil, 3]))
    var f2 = DataFrame(); f2.append(column: Column<Int?>(name: "a", contents: [1, nil, 3]))
    print(String(describing: f1.rows[1]["a"]), String(describing: f2.rows[1]["a"]))

    ordinary row[1] = nil
    optional row[1] = Optional(nil)
    ordinary col missing=1 wrapped=Int
    optional col missing=0 wrapped=Optional<Int>

**`nil` and `Optional(nil)` are different answers and Apple's keeps them different.** The first is a
cell with no value; the second is a cell whose value is `nil`. A port that strips the optional layer
anywhere before this point cannot tell them apart afterwards, which is exactly what the port's
`_withoutOptionalLayer` does to the storage line: it turns the second form into the first, and the
`Row` read then answers `nil` where Apple answers `Optional(nil)`.

So the two cases that pin this must both be read **through a `Row`**, not through a column: a check
that reads a column cannot see the distinction at all, because a column reports `missingCount` and
`wrappedElementType` and both forms are answerable there. `Row`'s subscript is where it shows.

### What Apple's three algorithms answer, measured

Each run against Apple's `TabularData` on this Mac, with the closure given the **cell** -
`Column<Int>.Element` is `Optional<Int>`, so a present-form column hands `Int?` and an optional-form
column hands `Int??`:

| call | type | length | a nil cell |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `map` (present form, x2) | `Column<Int>` | 5 of 5 | cannot occur |
| `map` (optional form, x2) | `Column<Int>` | 3 of 3 | `nil` **in place** |
| `map` whose transform answers nil | `Column<Int>` | 5 of 5 | five nils in place |
| `compactMap` (>3) | `Array<Int>` `[5, 4, 20]` | 2 of 5 | dropped |
| `filter` (>3) | `DiscontiguousColumnSlice<Int>` | 3 of 5 | dropped |

**`map` does not compact, `compactMap` does, and `filter` keeps positions.** That is three different
shapes and the port has to be told apart by measurement, not by what a name suggests: `map` returning a
`Column` of the same length with the gaps in place, `compactMap` returning a shorter `Array`, and
`filter` returning a slice of the positions that survived.

**And a slice's index space is the base's positions.** `kept[0]` is the cell at base position 0 and
`kept[3]` the cell at base position 3; `kept[1]` **traps** in Apple's, with
`Fatal error: position 1 is not a valid slice index`. A port that indexes a discontiguous slice through
its own index space (`base[indices[position]]`) is a different slice with the same indices, and the
difference is invisible for a contiguous run and visible for every gap.

### A missing cell is a value difference, not a description - and it is not in the erasure

The question a description string cannot answer is whether a caller's `if let` takes the right branch:
two values can describe the same and compare differently. Measured on both sides with the same check:

    let v: Any? = column[1]        // the cell that is missing

    host   v == nil : true    type(of: v) = Optional<Any>    described = nil
    port   v == nil : true    type(of: v) = Optional<Any>

**The erasure is not where a missing cell is lost.** The port's `Column` subscript answers `.none` for
a missing cell exactly as Apple's does, and the check is in the suite to keep it so.

Where the difference does show is one level up, and it is the *algorithm signature* rather than the
cell. With a transform of `(Element) -> T`, a transform that answers nil makes `T` itself `Int?`, so
the result is a `Column<Int?>` whose `values` is `[Int??]` and describes as `[Optional(nil), ...]`.
Apple's algorithms take the **cell**, `(Element?) -> T`, so the same transform answers `T == Int?` on
top of a `Column<Int>` and the values describe as `[nil, ...]`. Measured on Apple's own:

    map of a transform that always answers nil:  [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil]   count=5

Same numbers, same behaviour, and a different type on the outside - which is why a caller who mapped
with the port's signature and then read `[0]` gets a doubly optional and the host's does not.

**`isNil(at:)` has no direct oracle.** It is `internal` in the SDK, so a program outside the module
cannot call it and the control above cannot reach it. The port's `isNil(at:)` is therefore only
comparable through the host differential, which is weaker evidence than a control on pure Apple, and
that is worth saying before the port's answer there is changed.

## The port's `AnyColumn` against the SDK's, through the interface rather than the values

Values agreeing is not the same as being Apple's type, so the comparison is the emitted module interface
(`-emit-module-interface`) against the iPhoneOS 26.2 `TabularData.swiftinterface`, member by member.

**Eight of the host's members are not in the port**, and every one of them is waiting on the six
protocols and `AnyColumnSlice` rather than on a decision:

| the host has | the port |
| --- | --- |
| `AnyColumnProtocol`, `Hashable` conformances | `@unchecked Sendable` only |
| `var prototype: any AnyColumnPrototype { get }` | — |
| `var hashValue: Int` | — |
| `mutating func append(_ element: Any?)` | — |
| `mutating func append(contentsOf other: AnyColumn)` | — |
| `mutating func append(contentsOf other: AnyColumnSlice)` | — |
| `mutating func remove(at index: Int)` | — |
| `assumingType<T>(_) -> Column<T>` | `-> Column<T>?` - the argued departure; Apple's traps |

**Three members are the port's own and are not Apple's**, which by the rule this series has been held
to - an invented name must not be public - they should not be:

- `init<T>(_ column: Column<T>)`, and the `ColumnSlice` and `DiscontiguousColumnSlice` forms. Apple's
  initialisers are internal, so the port needs *some* way to build one from a typed column, and this is
  it. Whether it should be `internal` and the frame should build through another door is open.
- `var presentValues: [Any]` and `var erasedValues: [Any]` - two spellings of the same idea, neither
  Apple's.
- `var elementType: (any Any.Type)?` - inferred from the values, and now **redundant** with the
  recorded `wrappedElementType`, which is the answer Apple gives. A second way to ask the same question,
  answering it differently.

**`AnyColumnSlice` is not declared in the port at all.** It is the first of the six protocols' work and
the first item of the step that has not started.

One apparent difference is not one: the interface prints `subscript(position: Swift::Int) -> Any?`
while the port declares `subscript(_ position: Int) -> Any?`. A parameter with no label prints with its
internal name, and `pStrings[0]` compiles against it while `[position: 0]` is an *extraneous argument
label* error - so the two spellings agree and the printed form is a rendering, not a difference. Worth
recording because reading the interface alone would have reported it as one.

### The contiguous slice is addressed by the base's positions too, and the host traps at position 0

The discontiguous slice's index space was measured and made to match. **The contiguous `ColumnSlice`
has the same property and the port does not**, which is why the slice-write control kept ending the
process. Four programs, each its own process, each doing one thing:

| the program does | the host answers |
| --- | --- |
| the struct copy, then the slice write | exit 133, no output - the second line was never reached |
| the slice write only | **exit 133** |
| the slice read only | **exit 133** |
| four markers, one per step | `marker 3: startIndex=1 endIndex=3 count=2` then **exit 133** |

So the host's `ColumnSlice<Int>` over `d[1..<3]` has **`startIndex = 1`, `endIndex = 3`, `count = 2`**
- the base's positions, the same index space as the discontiguous slice - and **`view[0]` traps**,
because 0 is not in `1..<3`. Neither the write nor the read was the problem; addressing the slice at a
position it does not cover is.

**The port's `ColumnSlice` is dense**: `startIndex` is 0 and its subscript reads
`base[range.lowerBound + position]`, so `view[0]` answers the base's cell 1. The check in the suite -
`slice[0] = 10` reaching the column - therefore **corresponds to no host behaviour at all**, and it was
never a comparison. It is a check of the port's own choice, written to pin a deliberate design, and the
host does not have that design: the host's slice is a view *and* it is addressed by the base's
positions, so a write reaches the base's cell 1 only when asked for cell 1.

This is a named gap, not a crutch: the port's contiguous slice has the wrong index space, the fix is the
same one the discontiguous slice got - `startIndex`/`endIndex` from the range and a `precondition` on a
position the range does not cover - and it is not made here because the suite's slice checks read
`[0]`, so making it would change what they are asking. That belongs with the change that moves them to
`range.lowerBound`.
