# The release-13 rows of `registry/MetalPerformanceShaders/absent_MetalPerformanceShaders.json`

55 rows — **52 `class`, 2 `protocol`, 1 `method`** — sat at `absent` with the SDK's own declaration as
their only `source`, which is an assertion and not a measurement. This page holds the measurement,
the commands that reproduce it and their output, so a reviewer can settle any row here without a
second tool.

**The claim, in one line:** no held release below 16.0 carries any of the 55 names, so `absent` is
the correct verdict for all 55 and the gate's `held` check (`backports.lua:1904`) cannot fire on
any of them.

## Which releases can decide a 13.x row, and why these four

`check_registry` decides `held` at `backports.lua:1904`:

```lua
local natively = deployment and entry.introduced and dyld.compare_versions(deployment, entry.introduced) >= 0
if (entry.status == "absent" or entry.status == "owed") and in_range(entry, deployment) and not natively and carried_by_release(entry, inventory) then
```

`not natively` means the row is only ever in question at a `deployment` **below its `introduced`**,
so a 13.0/13.4 row can only be tested by a band that runs below 13.0. `band_plan`
(`backports.lua:2578`) then checks such a band against the first and last release of its range.
Four releases were read directly, and they are the four that matter:

| release | architecture | why it is here |
|---|---|---|
| **4.3** | armv7 | one of the two `cache-census.lua` names as "the two the package deploys on", and the older of them |
| **6.1.3** | armv7 | the other, and the tool's own default |
| **12.0** | arm64 | the newest held rung below 13.0, where a 13.0 API would most plausibly have leaked in |
| **16.0** | arm64e | **the control** — see the hole below |

### The hole, which is why the control is 16.0 and not 13.0

The held ladder (`~/.charon/dyld`) has **no 13.0, 14.0 or 15.0**. `ls ~/.charon/dyld` runs 3.0, 3.1.3,
3.2, 4.0, 4.3, 4.3.5, 5.0, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.0.2, 6.1, 6.1.3, 6.1.4, 6.1.6, 7.0 … 9.3.6, 10.0.1 …
10.3.4, 11.0, **12.0, 16.0**, 18.0 — 53 release directories, of which `dyld.held_ladder` uses the 50
that have an armv7/arm64 cache (it skips the armv6-only 1.1.4, 2.2.1 and 4.2.1). So a name the SDK
declares at 13.0 has **no held rung between 12.0 and 16.0**, and its oldest held carrier is 16.0.
That is why 16.0 is the control here rather than another absence: it is the rung that proves the
reader finds these names when they are there.

## The whole ladder, from the index

```
python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py < .agent-work/runs/w01-mps-r13/names.txt
```

Output — all 55 names:

```
weightsLayout	16.0
MPSCNNConvolutionTransposeGradient	16.0
… 54 more, every one 16.0 …
MPSTemporaryNDArray	16.0
```

`first-rung` answers **the OLDEST held release that carries the name** (its own docstring: "The
answer is the OLDEST held release that carries the name, because that is the release a port of it
must support"). So a first rung of 16.0 is not merely "it is in 16.0" — it is **no held release
older than 16.0 carries it**, which covers every rung between 4.3 and 12.0 that was not read
directly. That is the claim this page rests on.

### Four controls, and what each one rules out

```
$ printf 'MPSImageIntegral\nMPSImageGaussianBlur\nMPSImageBox\nMPSNDArrayAbs\n' | python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py
MPSImageIntegral	9.0
MPSImageGaussianBlur	9.0
MPSImageBox	9.0
MPSNDArrayAbs	NONE
$ printf 'NSString\nUIView\nNotARealClassNameXyz\n' | python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py
NSString	3.0
UIView	3.0
NotARealClassNameXyz	NONE
```

- `MPSImageIntegral`, `MPSImageGaussianBlur`, `MPSImageBox` → 9.0. The index resolves a Metal
  Performance Shaders **class name** and gives it a real MPS rung, so a `16.0` on this family is a
  rung and not a spelling the index failed to match. (A class's symbol is not `_MPSImageIntegral`:
  that spelling reads `NONE`, because the bare class name is the right one here.)
- `MPSNDArrayAbs` → NONE. A name from the right family, spelled like a real member, that no release
  has — so `NONE` is an answer the tool does give, and a `16.0` is not its way of saying "not found".
- `NSString` → 3.0, `UIView` → 3.0, `NotARealClassNameXyz` → NONE. The ladder is being walked and a
  made-up name reads nothing.

## The four caches, class-scoped, with the control in the same run

```
CHARON_ROOT=$PWD xmake l tools/corpus/cache-census.lua MPS 4.3 6.1.3 12.0 16.0
```

```
4.3       ~/.charon/dyld/4.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7
         images 354, of which naming MPS 0
         classes 7187, of which MPS* 6 (MPServerObject MPServerObjectProxy MPShuffledItemGroup MPSwipableView MPSwipeGestureRecognizer MPSystemNowPlayingController)

         classes 11378, of which MPS* 21 (MPSSLookupResponseTransformContext MPScrollingTitlesView MPServerObject … MPSwipableView MPSwipeGestureRecognizer MPSystemNowPlayingController)

         protocols 11426, of which MPS* 21 (MPSCNNBatchNormalizationDataSource MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource … MPSwipableViewDelegate)

         classes 143137, of which MPS* 961 (MPSANEWeightFileManager … MPSCNNGroupNormalization MPSCNNGroupNormalizationGradient MPSNDArray … MPSSVGFDenoiser MPSTemporalAA)
         protocols 25549, of which MPS* 34 (MPSCNNBatchNormalizationDataSource MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource MPSCNNGroupNormalizationDataSource … MPSNDArrayAllocator MPSSVGFTextureAllocator …)
control: 1504 name(s) beginning MPS found in this run, so a zero on another rung is the release's and not the reader's
```

**The 4.3 and 6.1.3 zeros are not MPS zeros.** Both caches carry `MPS*` names — 6 and 21 — and every
one of them is a different thing: `MPServerObject`, `MPStoreOfferArtworkImageCache`,
`MPShuffledItemGroup`, `MPSwipableView`, `MPSwipeGestureRecognizer`,
`MPSystemNowPlayingController`. They are MailStore, the shuffle controller and the system Now
Playing controller, and they share three letters with the framework and nothing else. **Zero images
in either cache name `MPS` at all**, and the earliest MPS names the index places are at 9.0
(`MPSImageIntegral`, `MPSImageGaussianBlur`, `MPSImageBox` all read 9.0 above) — so on the two
releases this package deploys on there is no substrate at all for any of these rows, which is the
`reason` these rows already carried, now measured instead of asserted.

### The exact, name-by-name answer

The census prints a truncated list, so the per-name answer comes from the dump `carried_by_release`
itself reads:

```
CHARON_ROOT=$PWD xmake l tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua ~/.charon/dyld/4.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7    > inv-4.3.tsv
CHARON_ROOT=$PWD xmake l tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua ~/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7  > inv-6.1.3.tsv
CHARON_ROOT=$PWD xmake l tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua ~/.charon/dyld/12.0/dyld_shared_cache_arm64  | grep -E '^(class|protocol)	MPS' > inv-12.0-mps.tsv
CHARON_ROOT=$PWD xmake l tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua ~/.charon/dyld/16.0/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e | grep -E '^(class|protocol)	MPS' > inv-16.0-mps.tsv
```

One TSV line per class, `class<TAB>name<TAB>superclass<TAB>image<TAB>instance selectors<TAB>class
selectors<TAB>protocols`, and one per protocol. The selector columns carry a `-` prefix, which is
what `carried_by_release` (`backports.lua:1612`) expects. Lines read: 7751 at 4.3, 12549 at 6.1.3,
480 MPS lines at 12.0, 995 at 16.0.

**Two independent tools agree on every release** — 4.3: 7187 + 564 = 7751, 6.1.3: 11378 + 1171 =
12549, 12.0: 459 + 21 = 480, 16.0: 961 + 34 = 995. The census's counts and the inventory's line
counts are the same numbers, so the two readers are reading the same cache.

| release | of the 54 class/protocol names |
|---|---|
| 4.3 | **0 / 54** carried |
| 6.1.3 | **0 / 54** carried |
| 12.0 | **0 / 54** carried |
| 16.0 | **54 / 54** carried |

### Six class controls, and the question they make real

A zero at 4.3 and 6.1.3 is only worth reading if the same reader finds MPS where MPS is. Six classes
the tree **already carries rows for**, run through the same three dumps:

```
MPSImageIntegral           4.3=-  6.1.3=-  12.0=Y  16.0=Y
MPSImageGaussianBlur       4.3=-  6.1.3=-  12.0=Y  16.0=Y
MPSImageBox                4.3=-  6.1.3=-  12.0=Y  16.0=Y
MPSCNNConvolution          4.3=-  6.1.3=-  12.0=Y  16.0=Y
MPSCNNBatchNormalization   4.3=-  6.1.3=-  12.0=Y  16.0=Y
MPSMatrixSum               4.3=-  6.1.3=-  12.0=Y  16.0=Y
```

6/6 absent where the framework is absent, 6/6 present where it is present. And 12.0 is not a lazy
control: it carries **459** MPS classes, among them the immediate neighbours of these rows —
`MPSCNNConvolutionTranspose`, `MPSCNNConvolutionTransposeNode`, `MPSCNNFullyConnected`,
`MPSCNNFullyConnectedGradient` — so the 0/54 at 12.0 is "the neighbourhood is there and these are
not", not "the reader was looking for the wrong family".

## The method row, and the trap that makes it its own question

`-[MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource weightsLayout]` is the one member in the slice, and
**a selector's rung says nothing about its owner**: at 16.0 six classes carry `-weightsLayout`
(`MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource`, `MPSCNNConvolution`, `MPSCNNConvolutionGradient`,
`MPSCNNConvolutionWeightsAndBiasesState`, `MPSGraphConvolution2DOpDescriptor`,
`MPSGraphDepthwiseConvolution2DOpDescriptor`), so a bare-selector first-rung answer could not say
whose member this is. The owner settles it:

| release | is `MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource` declared? | does it carry `-weightsLayout`? |
|---|---|---|
| 4.3 | no — no such owner exists | 0 classes anywhere on the release carry the selector |
| 6.1.3 | no — no such owner exists | 0 classes anywhere on the release carry the selector |
| 12.0 | **yes**, a protocol with 13 selectors | **no** — and `-kernelWeightsDataType` is not one either |
| 16.0 | **yes**, a protocol with 15 selectors | **yes** — and `-kernelWeightsDataType` is one |

12.0 is the answer that matters. Its protocol arrives in 11.3, so it is there to be asked, it has
thirteen selectors to choose from, and `-weightsLayout` is not among them: the two members added at
13.0 and 14.0 are exactly the two missing from 12.0's thirteen. At 16.0 the same protocol lists
fifteen and both are present, so the spelling of the selector is right and the reader finds it where
it exists. That is a real question asked of a real owner, not a formality.

## The registry's own source agrees, name for name

```
python3 -c '
import sys, collections
names=[l.strip() for l in open("names.txt") if l.strip()]
rows=[l.rstrip("\n").split("\t") for l in open(sys.argv[1])]
hit=[f for f in rows[1:] if f[3] in names or any(f[3].endswith(" "+n+"]") for n in names)]
print("surface rows matched:", len(hit), "of", len(names))
print("introduced:", dict(collections.Counter(f[4] for f in hit)))
print("registry column:", dict(collections.Counter(f[9] for f in hit)))
' $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/corpus/sdk-26.2-surface.tsv
```

```
surface rows matched: 55 of 55
introduced: {'13': 7, '13.0': 47, '13.4': 1}
registry column: {'absent': 55}
```

145301 rows, indexed on `api` (column 4) — column 0 is `framework` and reading that one is a
mistake that reports every name absent, which is how this table was first read here. All 55 are
present, all under `framework=MetalPerformanceShaders`, all with `registry=absent`, and every
`introduced` matching the registry row it backs: **13.0 for 47** (46 classes/protocols plus the one
member), `13` for 7, **13.4 for 1** (`MPSImageEDLines`). The member is present under its own
spelling `-[MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource weightsLayout]`, `introduced=13.0`; the same table has 14
rows naming `weightsLayout`, and the other 13 belong to MetalPerformanceShadersGraph's convolution
descriptors at 14.0 and 16.3, which is another slice's business.

**No row of the 55 disagrees with the SDK.** Unlike the UIKit 16.0 batch, which found two rows whose
`introduced` the cache does not corroborate, nothing here needed correcting — 16.0 is the oldest
held rung above the hole, so it cannot contradict a 13.0 declaration, only be consistent with it.

## A third source: the SDK's own availability macros

The surface table is the registry's source and the caches are the releases' own answer. The headers
are a third, independent witness, and they are on this machine inside the SDK digest the package
compiles against:

```
$HOME/.xmake/cache/packages/2609/i/iphoneos-sdk/26.2/resources/markers/iPhoneOS16.5.sdk.tar.xz.dir/iPhoneOS16.5.sdk/\
System/Library/Frameworks/MetalPerformanceShaders.framework
```

All **55 of 55** are declared there — 52 classes, 2 protocols and the owner of the member — and every
one of the 54 class and protocol declarations carries an availability macro on the line above it.
Read backwards from each `@interface`/`@protocol`:

| the SDK's own annotation | rows |
|---|---|
| `ios(13.0)` | 46 |
| `ios(13)` | 7 |
| `ios(13.4)` | 1 (`MPSImageEDLines`, `MPSImageEDLines.h:37`) |
| **disagreeing with the registry's `introduced`** | **0** |

The member row agrees in the same way, from its own line: `MPSCNNConvolution.h:833` annotates
`weightsLayout` with `MPS_AVAILABLE_STARTING(macos(10.15), ios(13.0), macCatalyst(13.0), tvos(13.0))`,
which is the registry's 13.0 read off the declaration rather than off a table. The reader for this
self-checks on a case that can be read by eye — `MPSNNGridSample.h` line 26 is
`MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING( macos(10.15), ios(13.0), macCatalyst(13.0), tvos(13.0))` and line 27 is
`@interface MPSNNGridSample : MPSCNNBinaryKernel`.

Three sources now agree on `introduced`: the surface table, the headers, and — for the names rather
than the versions — the caches, where all 54 read 16.0.

## The port side: it exports none of them either

```
grep -rIln --include='*.m' --include='*.h' --include='*.c' --include='*.mm' \
    -E "$(paste -sd'|' names.txt)" packages/a/apple-backports/
```

**0 files.** No header in the package declares any of the 55 and no object defines one, so
`implemented` is not true of any of them today and `answered` (`backports.lua:1871-1895`, "listed
as absent, but what is built answers it") cannot fire either.

## Why this band is the absence and not an object

The rulebook allows an audit to be half a band "UNLESS IT PROVES THE ABSENCE", and then: *if the
rows are blocked on substrate no band end carries, proving the absence at both ends with a
certified control IS the band*. Measured, that is the situation here, and there is a second reason
besides the substrate:

- **No band end carries any of these names to compare against.** `absent` is settled; but `implemented`
  is a different claim, and it needs an oracle.
- **The host cannot be one.** This machine's MPS does not run: 15 rows of this very file record that
  its AGX family lacks `computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:` and that the release's own kernel
  dies encoding with `'[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer mtlnext computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:]`,
  unrecognized selector`. Every `implemented` MPS row in the tree says the same thing about its own
  numbers — "no number on this row is a measurement of Apple's code".
- **So the reference would have to come from the header, and these headers do not give one.** This is
  the line that separates this slice from the MPS 9.0 rows that *are* implemented:
  `MPSImageIntegral.h:19-20` states its rectangle exactly — `sumRect.origin =
  MPSUnaryImageKernel.offset`, `sumRect.size = dest_position - MPSUnaryImageKernel.clipRect.origin` —
  which is a formula a plain C reference can be written from, and `MPSImageIntegral` is `implemented`
  against it. Read against the 16.5 SDK (`$HOME/.xmake/cache/packages/2609/i/iphoneos-sdk/26.2/
  resources/markers/iPhoneOS16.5.sdk.tar.xz.dir/iPhoneOS16.5.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/
  MetalPerformanceShaders.framework`), the headers of this slice describe **compute kernels and
  their buffers**: `MPSCore/Headers/MPSNDArray.h:27` gives `MPSNDArrayDescriptor` a `dataType`, a
  `numberOfDimensions`, `lengthOfDimension:`, a per-dimension `sliceRangeForDimension:` and a
  `dimensionOrder` — the shape of the container, not the arithmetic of a kernel. `MPSCNNConvolution.h:2196`
  declares `MPSNNGramMatrixCalculation : MPSCNNKernel`, and a kernel class is named for the device to
  run, not for a CPU to imitate. `MPSNNGridSample.h:21` says what it computes in one sentence — "Given
  an input and a flow-field grid, computes the output using input values and pixel locations from the
  grid" — and then hands the rest to a URL, `MPSNNGridSample.h:22`, "More details at
  https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#grid-sample". A PyTorch doc page is a reference to what a
  library does on one framework, not a statement of what a value must be on this one. Writing a class that satisfies the name and guessing the contents would be
  a crutch under §9, and a registry row asserting it would be worse than an honest `absent`.

### The one header in this slice that does state its algorithm, and why it still lands at absent

This has to be said plainly, because the opposite was claimed in an earlier commit of this series
and it was wrong: **`MPSImageEDLines.h` is not one of the headers that state nothing.** Its
`@discussion` gives the EDLines algorithm in five numbered steps and two formulas — `G = sqrt(Sx^2 +
Sy^2)`, `G_ang = arctan(Sy / Sx)` for the Sobel gradient, then anchor points, then tracing along the
gradient direction, then fitting and extending lines — and its annotation is
`MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING( macos(10.15.4), ios(13.4), macCatalyst(13.4), tvos(13.4))` at
`MPSImageEDLines.h:37`, which is the registry's 13.4 read from the header itself.

It is still `absent`, and the reason is the difference between an algorithm and a value. Steps 1 and 2
are arithmetic a reference can be written from. Steps 3 to 5 are **decisions** the header describes at
paper level and does not pin down: which local maximum counts as an anchor point, the exact order in
which forward and backward tracing stops, how a line is fitted to the traced points, and what
"extended along the edge" means when the error crosses `lineErrorThreshold`. Two implementations that
both follow this text can label different line segments, so a CPU port of it could be graded only
against a reference this port itself wrote — which is exactly the claim `implemented` makes and the
one thing here that cannot be checked. There is still no oracle: this host's MPS does not run (above),
and no held release below 16.0 carries `MPSImageEDLines`, so there is nothing to compare a port's
answer with. **What is specified is recorded below; what is decided is what cannot be claimed.**

The eight rows of `MPSRayIntersector.framework` are a step further and are not merely unspecified.
Measured from the SDK, `MPSPolygonBuffer`, `MPSPolygonAccelerationStructure` and
`MPSQuadrilateralAccelerationStructure` are declared in that framework — `MPSPolygonBuffer : NSObject`,
`MPSPolygonAccelerationStructure : MPSAccelerationStructure`, `MPSQuadrilateralAccelerationStructure :
MPSPolygonAccelerationStructure` — and `MPSSVGF`, `MPSSVGFDenoiser`, `MPSSVGFDefaultTextureAllocator`,
`MPSSVGFTextureAllocator` and `MPSTemporalAA` sit beside them in the same framework. They exist to
build and read **ray-tracing acceleration structures** on the device, so a host object with the same
name and a CPU walk inside it is a different capability wearing the row's name.

### The MPSNDArray family is one chain, and the chain is broken at its root

Read off the SDK's own superclasses, which is why a partial host object could not answer these rows
even if someone wrote one:

```
MPSNDArrayUnaryKernel        : MPSNDArrayMultiaryGradientKernel
MPSNDArrayUnaryGradientKernel: MPSNDArrayMultiaryGradientKernel
MPSNDArrayMultiaryGradientKernel : MPSNDArrayMultiaryBase
MPSNDArrayMultiaryBase       : MPSKernel
MPSNDArrayMultiaryKernel     : MPSNDArrayMultiaryBase
MPSNDArrayBinaryKernel       : MPSNDArrayMultiaryKernel
MPSNDArrayGather             : MPSNDArrayBinaryKernel
MPSNDArrayGatherGradient     : MPSNDArrayBinaryPrimaryGradientKernel
MPSNDArrayStridedSlice       : MPSNDArrayUnaryKernel
MPSNDArrayStridedSliceGradient : MPSNDArrayUnaryGradientKernel
MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication : MPSNDArrayMultiaryKernel
MPSTemporaryNDArray          : MPSNDArray
MPSNDArray                   : NSObject          <- the root, and it is itself a row of this slice
```

Every one of these rows is absent for the same measured reason and they are absent **together**: the
deepest ones inherit from `MPSNDArray`, which is one of the 55 and which 0 of 54 held rungs carry.

## What a caller gets

- **A class row** (`MPSNDArray`, `MPSSVGF`, `MPSPolygonBuffer`, …): the class is not in the release
  and the port exports none, so `NSClassFromString(@"MPSNDArray")` answers nil, and a caller that
  built against a compile-time reference gets nothing to send to.
- **A protocol row** (`MPSCNNGroupNormalizationDataSource`, `MPSSVGFTextureAllocator`): the protocol
  is not declared, so `NSProtocolFromString` answers nil and a conformer cannot be declared against
  a header the port installs.
- **The method row**: a caller can still write `-weightsLayout` in its own `MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource`
  conformer — nothing rejects that — and nothing will ever call it, because the framework that would
  call it is absent from every release the port runs on and the port does not supply one. Its answer
  is fully pinned down, which is worth recording: `MPSCNNConvolution.h:832` declares it
  `-(MPSCNNConvolutionWeightsLayout) weightsLayout` with `MPS_AVAILABLE_STARTING(macos(10.15),
  ios(13.0), macCatalyst(13.0), tvos(13.0))`, the doc comment says "Currently only OHWI layout is
  supported which is default", and the enum it returns (`MPSCNNConvolution.h:399`) has exactly one
  case, `MPSCNNConvolutionWeightsLayoutOHWI = 0`. So on a release that had the protocol the only
  answer was 0, and a conformer written today can return 0 and be correct — it simply is never asked.

## What a reader should take from this

Every row of the file at release 13 says `absent`, and that is now a measurement rather than a queue
entry: **0/54 carried at 4.3, 0/54 at 6.1.3, 0/54 at 12.0, 54/54 at 16.0; the owner of the one
member row declares it in 16.0 and not in 12.0; 6/6 class controls and 1504 MPS names in the same
run; 0 files in the package name any of the 55; and all 54 declarations carry an SDK availability
macro that agrees with their registry `introduced` — 46 at `ios(13.0)`, 7 at `ios(13)`, 1 at
`ios(13.4)`, none disagreeing.** No status here is wrong, and none of these rows should be read as
work not started: the substrate is absent at every band end, and the oracle that an `implemented` row
would need does not exist on this machine or in any cache the port holds.
