# What MetalPerformanceShaders still owes, per class family

Regenerate with `python3 tools/mps-owed-count.py --out <this file>`. Every number is
produced by that script and every rule below is implemented in it.

## The counting rule

A **family** is the SDK's own header file name minus `.h`. MPSImageReduce.h declares the
reductions, so those are one family because the SDK puts them in one file. Membership is
read off the headers - the script finds which header declares each API - and is never a
name list written by hand, which is what rots. An API no header declares is reported
separately instead of being guessed into a neighbouring family.

**owed** is rows in `absent_MetalPerformanceShaders.json` whose api a header of that family declares.
**26.2 headers** is the MPS types the iPhoneOS 26.2 surface declares there. **introduced**
is the registry row's own field, never guessed from header text.

Demand is not the ranking, and that is measured: MPS has no rows in the corpus hint ledger
and none in any crash-demand file, because a compute framework is not in a crash top-list.
So the ranking is owed surface, which is what the registry and the headers can count.
