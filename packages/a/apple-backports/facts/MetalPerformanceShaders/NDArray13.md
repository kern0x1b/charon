# The NDArray substrate of iOS 13, and the three kernels that stand on it

`MPSNDArray`, `MPSNDArrayDescriptor`, `MPSTemporaryNDArray` and the allocator, then the
`MPSNDArrayMultiaryBase` family and the kernels that carry real arithmetic: `MPSNDArrayGather` and
its gradient, `MPSNDArrayStridedSlice` and its gradient, and `MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication`. The
source is the headers of the SDK of iOS 16.4 - `MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h`, `MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayKernel.h`,
`MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayGather.h`, `MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayStridedSlice.h`,
`MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication.h` and `MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayGradientState.h`.

## What was measured, and against what

`tests/backports/host/mpsndarray/run.sh` builds the same case file twice and compares the two runs
line by line: once against the system's own MetalPerformanceShaders, once against this port's classes
renamed out of the way. **31 lines compared, 0 mismatches**, and both planted builds are caught.

The reason a release-side oracle is possible here at all is that an `MPSNDArray` is storage, not a
kernel. This is the one part of MPS the release's own framework answers on this host - and it is worth
being exact about the boundary, because the image and matrix families in this package cannot make the
claim: `tests/backports/host/mpsimage9/run.sh` records that this host's AGX family does not implement
`computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:`, and the release's own `MPSImage` kernels die encoding with
`-[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer mtlnext computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:]: unrecognized selector`.
The three kernels here are NOT covered by that oracle and their rows say so.

**Two cases the release cannot answer on this host**, and this is measured rather than assumed. Its own
`-exportDataWithCommandBuffer:toBuffer:destinationDataType:offset:rowStrides:`, and its
`MPSAliasingStrategyShallNotAlias` copy path, both die with

    -[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer_mtlnext retainedReferences]: unrecognized selector

raised inside `MPSCore`'s `MPSNewBufferForTexture` on its way to `MPSDecrementReadCount`. So the same
AGX-family limitation the image family records is reached here through a STORAGE path rather than a
compute one. Those two cases live in `export-cases.m`, which runs against the port alone, states its
own expectations and is labelled as such; no number from it measures Apple's code.

## Four things the release's own answers settled, each of which was wrong here first

Every one of these was implemented the way the headers read, and the differential caught it. They are
written down because a reader who trusts the header's prose over the release's behaviour will make
the same four mistakes.

**The storage is packed; the 16-byte row is an allocation size, not an address.** The class
discussion recommends a row "at least a multiple of 16 bytes", and `-resourceSize` of a `[2,3,4,5]`
float32 array answers 960 - 16 bytes a row over `3*4*5` rows. It is tempting to read that as the
element at `(1,2,3,4)` living at `1 + 2*4 + 3*12 + 4*48`. It does not: cases 5, 6, 7 and 8 each name
the values and only the packed reading answers all four. A `[2,3]` array written `1..6` and read
back gives `1 3 5 2 4 6` transposed, which is `d0 + 2*d1` and not `d0 + 4*d1`.

**`-lengthOfDimension:` on a DESCRIPTOR reads through the permutation; on an ARRAY it does not.** A
`[2,3]` descriptor transposed on dimensions 0 and 1 - the header's own worked example at
`MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h:70-74` - answers `-lengthOfDimension:0` with **3** (case 4). A transposed VIEW
of a `[2,3]` array answers **2** (case 7), and a view of a `[3,4,2]` array sliced on dimension 1
answers **3, 4, 2** (case 6) - the whole shape, with the slice not narrowing it. The header permits
that second one: "The dimension length is at least as large as the existing slice length"
(`MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h:235-237`). So the array keeps its whole shape beside its view descriptor, and a
walk that bounded itself by `-lengthOfDimension:` would run off the end of every slice.

**A slice changes the packed walk and not the shape.** Case 6's view reads twelve elements - the
slice's own values in the slice's own order, `7 8 9 10 11 12` then `19 20 21 22 23 24` - out of a view
whose shape says twenty-four. The twelve past the slice are zero, which is why `-readBytes:` here
clears the caller's buffer before gathering rather than leaving whatever was in it.

**A nil `strideBytes` array means PACKED, which is a different number from the storage stride.** The
header says the strides are "calculated for you assuming that the data is packed without additional
space in between elements, rows, etc" (`MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h:389-392`). So a non-nil array is the
caller's own byte stride per dimension, and a nil one is the packed form; the two sides of a copy are
separate walks and neither is derived from the other.

## The plant, and why this object's is not the family-wide one

The matrix family's control is `CHARON_PLANT` in `CharonMPS.h`, which perturbs what `CharonMPSStore`
writes. **It cannot reach this object, and that is measured.** This file copies BYTES and never calls
the store - the release's own accessors copy bytes too, "Copy bytes from MPSNDArray into buffer" and
"Copy bytes from a buffer into the MPSNDArray" (`MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h:383` and `:397`) - so a plant on
the store path produces a byte-identical binary and a green run the harness did not earn. The control
here is `CHARON_NDARRAY_PLANT`, which perturbs the copy itself.

Two things about it were found by the harness refusing to go green, and both are worth recording:

- The values are printed as **raw bytes**, not as `%.6g`. A planted build that shifts one bit of one
  element's exponent is invisible at six significant figures - `1.0f` and `1.0000002f` print the same -
  and the first version of this harness reported `PLANT 1 SURVIVED` for exactly that reason.
- The plant **adds**, it does not exclusive-or. The macro is on both the write and the read, so an
  exclusive-or applied twice over one element - once storing it into the array, once gathering it out
  - cancels, and the planted build printed exactly the unplanted bytes. The harness caught that as a
  second `PLANT SURVIVED`, which is the control working.

## What a view is, and what it costs

`MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h`'s class discussion is the source: a slice and a transpose are usually DEFERRED,
"the slice is performed first and the result of the slice is transposed", and two arrays that share a
common ancestor alias. So a view here is the parent's buffer, an offset and a permutation of the
parent's strides - no copy, and `-parent` answers the array it views.

`MPSAliasingStrategyShallNotAlias` is "Always make a copy" (`MPSCoreTypes.h:329`), and it is honoured
rather than ignored: a view that ignored it would answer a request the header defines with something
that aliases. It is a port-only case, in `export-cases.m`, because the release cannot reach it on this
host.

## The three kernels, and what is NOT claimed about them

`MPSNDArrayGather` and its gradient, `MPSNDArrayStridedSlice` and its gradient, and
`MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication` are the three classes of the family whose bodies the header specifies
well enough to write from. **Their encode paths are not measured against the release.** They encode
into a command buffer this host cannot commit, which is the same limitation the image family records,
so `kernel-cases.m` compares them against a plain C reference written from the header's own wording and
computed in the same process: **69 elements compared, 0 mismatches**, and both planted builds fail it.

So every row for these five classes says, in its own `effect`, that its numbers are the port's own
against that reference and that no number on it measures Apple's code.

**Dimension 0 is the COLUMNS, which three separate things turned on.**

- the matrix multiplication. A matrix is "stored in the two most major dimensions" of the array
  (`MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication.h:33-35`) and the major row - the dimension whose elements are
  adjacent in memory - is the 0th, so a `[2,3]` array is **three rows of two**, not two rows of three.
  The first version had dimension 0 as the row and answered 76 100 103 136 where the correct product of
  the same twelve numbers is 27 30 33 61 68 75 95 106 117.
- the gather's own expectation, and here **the case file was wrong twice and the port was right**,
  which is the part worth recording: a `[3,2]` source gathered on axis 0 was expected to be
  `5 6 1 2 5 6`, which reads the source as three rows of two. With dimension 0 fastest the source is
  two rows of three and the answer is `3 1 3 6 4 6`. The second version of that reference had the
  result's four columns and three rows the other way round. An expectation written from a misreading
  cannot fail the right thing, and the harness saying so twice is the case for writing the derivation
  next to the numbers.
- a strided slice's count, which is a **ceiling**: a stride of 2 over a dimension of 5 holds three
  elements, not two, or the last element of every odd dimension is dropped.

**Two things a gradient pass must take from the STATE, and both were wrong first.**

`MPSNDArrayUnaryGradientKernel`'s RFC comment says it outright: "There is currently no way to manually
set this information for the gradient. This may not be viewed as a problem as this information is
automatically set by the gradient state" (`MPSNDArrayKernel.h:318-321`). The two things are:

- the gather's **axis**, which is a property of the forward kernel and of nothing in the data. It
  cannot be recovered from the two arrays' shapes: a gather on axis 0 of a `[3,2]` source by *three*
  indices has a result of the same `[3,2]` shape, so a shape-difference derivation refuses the one case
  where the index count happens to equal the axis length. The state records it, read from the kernel
  through the `axis` selector the release declares for it.
- the strided slice's **strides**, which `MPSNDArrayStridedSliceGradient` does not declare a property
  for. Reading the gradient kernel's own filter - all ones, the default - scattered the incoming
  gradient PACKED: a stride of 2 over 5 landed on 0 1 2 where the forward pass had read 0 2 4, and the
  harness reported `7 8 9 0 0` against the reference's `7 0 8 0 9`.

And the corollary, which was the same bug from the other side: **a gradient pass must not record the
state over the forward pass's.** The state's whole content is the FORWARD filter, and an encode that
re-recorded it from the gradient kernel replaced the forward strides and offsets with the defaults -
the strided-slice defect above, caused from the other end.

**A gather's gradient is a scatter-ACCUMULATE over the RESULT's positions.** The forward pass read
`source[indices[r], rest]` into `result[r, rest]`, so the incoming gradient at `result[r, rest]` belongs
at `source[indices[r], rest]`, and two result positions naming the same index sum. The first version
walked the INDEX array and took one gradient element per index, which is right only when the gradient
has exactly as many elements as there are indices; for the measured case it wrote `0 0 60 0 0 0` where
the answer is `20 0 40 50 0 100`.

## Three defects the harness found that are not about any of the above

They are recorded because none of them is visible in the source and all three would have shipped.

- **An over-release of a singleton.** `+[MPSNDArray defaultAllocator]` answers the same object every
  time, and the kernel's `-dealloc` releases its allocator. Storing it in `-init` without a retain made
  the *second* kernel ever built take the singleton's own retain count down: a SIGSEGV inside
  `objc_release` at the end of the first case that built one and released it.
- **Two pairs of declared encodes that were missing**, each found by its name in the report rather
  than by anything a reader would notice: the binary gradients' `primarySourceArray:` /
  `secondarySourceArray:` pair (`MPSNDArrayKernel.h:532-539`) and the unary gradient's `sourceArray:`
  pair (`:344-353`). Only the multiary spellings existed, so a caller of the header's own signature
  got `unrecognized selector`.
- **An odometer that never advanced its last dimension**, which overran a short cycle: a `[2,3,4]`
  array's walk visited 24 positions through 6 distinct addresses and wrote every fourth element. It is
  the sort of defect that reads as correct in a two-dimensional case, which is why every case here is
  at least two dimensional and the batch case is four.
