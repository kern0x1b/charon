# PDFOutline over the document's /Outlines tree

## What it is, and what it took to reach

`PDFOutline` is a class neither band carries: `objc.inventory` reports it as carried by neither 6.1.3 nor
4.3, with `ZZNotAClassAnywhere` answering "not carried". So it is the port's own, like `PDFDocument`,
`PDFPage`, `PDFBorder` and the action family.

An outline is a **linked structure**, not a tree of nested dictionaries. PDF 1.7 Table 8.2:

* the catalog names a root dictionary through `/Outlines`, and that dictionary holds the `/First` of the
  top-level chain;
* every item names its `/Parent`, its `/Prev` and its `/Next`;
* an item's children are its `/First` … `/Last` chain, and `/Count` sits on the item itself.

So the fixtures cannot be written as a literal — the object numbers depend on how many items are above
them — and `build_outline()` in `tools/make-object-fixtures.py` emits the whole tree from a nested spec
with every number measured as it is written. Two arithmetic bugs in that generator are worth recording
because both were silent and both looked like "the host cannot read outlines":

* the first object a fixture may write was computed as `5 + page_count + 1` instead of
  `3 + 2 * page_count + len(annotations) + 1`, so **every reference in every outline fixture was one too
  high** and the host answered *no outline root at all*. The fixtures now print their own object numbers,
  so a wrong one is visible without running the host.
* the outline root dictionary takes its number **before** the items, because a top-level item's `/Parent`
  *is* that dictionary and its number has to be known before the items are written.

And one fixture bug in the older makers, which this family exposed: **the `/Pages` node carried no
`/Parent`.** A conforming writer emits one, and nothing can walk *up* from a page to the catalog without
it — which is exactly how `-outlineRoot` finds the `/Outlines`. Every fixture in the harness now has it.

## `-[PDFDocument outlineRoot]`, and the catalog

The catalog comes from **`CGPDFDocumentGetCatalog`** — `CGPDFDocument.h:172`, `CG_AVAILABLE_STARTING(10.3,
2.0)`, in the release SDK this port builds against. That is the whole of it, and this page first said
otherwise: I took `CGPDFDocumentGetDictionary` — a name I had half-remembered — to be absent from both the
header and the export table, concluded the trailer was unreachable, and **walked up from page 1 through
`/Parent` instead**.

The walk was worse than unnecessary, and the reason matters more than the mistake: **it only ever worked
because the same commit had given the root `/Pages` node a `/Parent`.** A real PDF does not put one there
— the catalog is the parent of the page tree in that the *trailer's* `/Root` names it — so on any real
document `-outlineRoot` would have answered `nil`, and the differential would have said so had the fixtures
been real. That fixture change is reverted, every fixture in the harness is an ordinary document again, and
`run.sh` now removes its run directory before generating, so a renamed fixture cannot leave a ghost of its
old name behind to be walked and compared.

The root is then an outline like any other — measured: it answers an **empty** `-label` because it carries
no `/Title`, `-numberOfChildren` from its `/First` chain, `-index` 0, a nil `-parent` and a `-document` —
so it is built by the same constructor the items are, with no parent and index 0.

## The members

| member | measured |
| --- | --- |
| `-init` | the header's designated initializer (`PDFOutline.h:20`); a fresh one answers an empty label, no children, index 0, closed, no parent, no document, no destination, no action |
| `-document` | an object for the root and every item of every fixture; nil for a fresh `-init` |
| `-parent` | an object for every item; nil for every root |
| `-numberOfChildren` | the length of the `/First` … `/Next` chain; 0 when there is no `/First` |
| `-index` | **zero-based** — the second child of `outline-open`'s root answers 1, the fourth of `outline-nocount` answers 3, the root answers 0 |
| `-childAtIndex:` | the item at that position |
| `-label` | the `/Title`; a **missing** `/Title` answers an **empty string**, not nil |
| `-isOpen` | see below — not the format's rule |
| `-destination` | the `/Dest`: an array is the destination, a name or string builds one with a nil page, anything else nil |
| `-action` | see below — the opposite order from an annotation's |

## `-isOpen`: a positive `/Count` means OPEN, and a rule about two keys

**A positive `/Count` means OPEN, and the host agrees with Table 8.2.** This page first said the host read
the sign the other way round; that was my reading of the specification, not the host's behaviour, and it
was wrong. Table 8.2's `/Count` entry says a positive count means expanded and a negative one collapsed, so
`isOpen` answering **YES** for a positive count is the format's own reading.

The measurement is unchanged and it is what fixes the rule: `outline-signs.pdf` carries two items of the
*same shape* — two children each — one with `/Count +4` and one with `/Count -4`, and the positive one
answers `isOpen` **YES** and the negative one **NO**. So the first clause is: *an item with a `/Count`
answers YES when the count is positive.*

The two fixtures that carry one whole shape each are named for the sign rather than for open and closed,
because the earlier names were **backwards**: `outline-collapsed.pdf` is the one whose root carries a
negative `/Count` — collapsed — and `outline-expanded.pdf` the positive one.

The second clause took four fixtures, because "no `/Count`" turned out not to be enough. An item with no
`/Count` answers YES only when it has no `/Title` either:

| fixture | leaf | `/Title` | `isOpen` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `outline-titlekey` | under "None" | **absent** | **YES** |
| `outline-titlekey` | under "Empty" | `/Title ()` | NO |
| `outline-titlekey` | under "Text" | `/Title (leaf)` | NO |
| `outline-titlekey` | under "NoTitleNoF" | absent, and no `/F` either | YES |
| `outline-titlekey` | under "NoTitleWithDest" | absent, with a `/Dest` | YES |
| `outline-nocount` | A, B, C, D | all titled, none with a `/Count` | NO, NO, NO, NO |
| `outline-untitled` | four items deep | all absent | NO, NO, NO, **YES** |
| `outline-titled` | four items deep | all titled | NO, NO, NO, NO |

`outline-untitled.pdf` and `outline-titled.pdf` are the pair that isolates it: two chains of four items
with **the same shape**, differing only in whether each `/Title` is written, and the untitled one answers
YES at the leaf where the titled one answers NO three times out of three runs. The item's `/F` and
`/Dest` make no difference, which `outline-titlekey`'s last two rows fix.

So the rule is: **YES when the `/Count` is positive, and YES when there is no `/Count` and no `/Title`.**
Whether that is what the host means or a side effect of how it stores the flag is written down nowhere in
the SDK; this is what it answers, and each clause above is the fixture that fixes it.

## `-action`: the opposite order from an annotation's

An outline item and an annotation carry the same two keys, and **the host reads them in opposite
priorities**. `outline-shapes.pdf`'s "Child" carries `/Dest [3 0 R /XYZ 1 2 3]` *and* `/A << /S /GoTo /D
[3 0 R /Fit] >>`, and the host answers the **`/Dest`'s** 1, 2, 3 for both `-destination` and `-action`.

`ann-dest-and-a.pdf` is the annotation with the same pair, and it answers the **`/A`'s** `/Fit` — which is
what `PDFAnnotation11.m` implements, and why the two are separate rules rather than one shared one.

So: a `/Dest` gives a GoTo synthesised over it (Table 8.2: an item's `/Dest` *is* the destination of a
go-to action), and an `/A` is read only by an item with no `/Dest` — measured on `outline-open`'s "Two", a
`/URI` action, which answers `PDFActionURL`. An item with neither answers nil for both.

## `-childAtIndex:` out of range: there are TWO answers, and only one of them is a raise

Measured on `outline-collapsed.pdf`'s whole tree — every node asked at every index from 0 to its own child
count:

| node | at index = its child count |
| --- | --- |
| the root, two children | **raises** `NSRangeException`, `"childAtIndex: 2 out of bounds"` |
| "Two One"'s parent, one child | **raises**, `"childAtIndex: 1 out of bounds"` |
| "One One One", "One Two", "Two One" — **no children** | **nil**, even at index 0 |

So the rule is not "past the end raises". It is: **a node with a `/First` chain raises when the index runs
off it, and a node with no chain answers nil.** The port implements exactly that, and the harness compares
both answers through `@try`, printing the **exception's name** for a raise and `nil`/`an-object`
otherwise — so a side that raises where the host answers nil, or the reverse, names itself.

Both the raise and the nil have red controls over them, at a node with children and at a leaf.

## What is NOT here, and why

* **`-insertChild:atIndex:` and `-removeFromParent`** — the two write paths. Both are registered `inert`
  with that reason: nothing in this port writes a PDF, so a method that changed an outline would either
  answer without changing the file behind it or have to grow a writer. It is the same boundary
  `PDFAnnotation`'s `-setValue:forAnnotationKey:` rows name.
* **Nothing else.** `-childAtIndex:`'s two out-of-range answers are implemented, as above.

## The run

    $ sh tests/backports/host/pdfkit-document/run.sh
      images differ by construction: host=/System/…/PDFKit.framework/…/PDFKit
                                      port=…/runs/pdfkit-document/port-side
      COMPARED 7752 MISMATCHES 0  (not compared: 117, expected to differ: 351, of which 72 compared from the Catalyst side)
      RED CONTROL ok: the comparison goes red on a mutated port, and names the key

115 fixtures, 100 of them this series' — 3 box, 3 hand-written text, 9 annotation and 2 conforming-writer
text from before, plus 98 from `tools/make-object-fixtures.py`, each with every xref offset measured from
the object bytes as they are written.

98 named red controls, 26 of them naming an outline key. Two of them exist because this family got two
things wrong that a control has to catch:

* `outline-signs.pdf.c0.outline.isOpen` and `outline-signs.pdf.c1.outline.isOpen` — the two items of the
  same shape with opposite `/Count` signs. A control on one of them proves the flag is read at all; a
  control on both together is what would catch a sign flip.
* `outline-untitled.pdf.c0.c0.c0.c0.outline.isOpen` against `outline-titled.pdf.c0.c0.c0.c0.outline.isOpen`
  — the same position in the untitled chain and in the titled one. Those two keys differ **only** because
  of the `/Title`, so a mutant that made them equal is caught by planting on either.

The harness's own printing had to be fixed twice for this family, both times in the same way: a line
carrying several `key=value` pairs registers as **one** key and loses the rest, so every outline fact is
printed one key per line — the shape every other fact in this harness already had.
