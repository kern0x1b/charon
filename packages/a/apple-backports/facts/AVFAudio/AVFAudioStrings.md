# The string constants of AVFAudio this library carries

Twenty-five of them, in five object files, one file per release the strings arrived in - an object is
carried from one release on (`modules/apple/backports.lua`, `minimums()`: an object whose registry
entries name different minimums is refused), so a 7.0 string cannot sit in a 14.0 file.

**Every value was read out of a real release. None was written from the name.** Two readers, and
where both cover a name they agree:

| Reader | How |
| --- | --- |
| the arm64e shared cache of iOS 18.0 | `.agent-work/plan-and-analysis/avfaudio/cfconst.lua`, the symbol's address from `libAVFAudio.dylib`'s export trie, then the pointer it holds, then the `__cfstring` that pointer names, then the bytes - with `cache.pointer_at` applying the cache's own slide info. The control for the reader is `UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString` in the same cache, which it answers `app-settings:`. |
| the arm64 caches of iOS 7.0 and 12.0 | the same reader, on a cache that is one file, where the image is `/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/libAVFAudio.dylib`. |
| the host's own AVFAudio | `.agent-work/plan-and-analysis/avfaudio/probe3.c` and `probe4.c`, `dlsym` for the symbol and `CFStringGetCString` for the bytes. |

`tools/cfconst.py` in the repository root reads a **32-bit** cache header and a 16-byte symbol entry
and cannot read the 64-bit split caches 16.0 and 18.0 are; the reader above is the same walk over
`modules/apple/dyld.lua`'s `open_cache`/`pointer_at`, which is what the header layout of those caches
needs. Its one known gap is the `.dyldlinkedit` sub-cache of a split cache: the export trie of
16.0's and 18.0's AVFAudio image has the older names, and the image's symbol table that holds the
rest is in the linkedit sub-cache, which `read_address` maps but the image's own `__LINKEDIT` offsets
do not reach. That gap is why the six 14.0 port names below have the host as their only source.

| Constant | Value | Read from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeOutput` | `Output` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeMusicDevice` | `Music Device` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeMusicEffect` | `Music Effect` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeFormatConverter` | `Format Converter` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeEffect` | `Effect` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeMixer` | `Mixer` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypePanner` | `Panner` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeGenerator` | `Generator` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeOfflineEffect` | `Offline Effect` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitTypeMIDIProcessor` | `MIDI Processor` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitManufacturerNameApple` | `Apple` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitComponentTagsDidChangeNotification` | `AVAudioUnitComponentTagsDidChangeNotification` | 18.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioUnitComponentManagerRegistrationsChangedNotification` | `AVAudioUnitComponentManagerRegistrationsChangedNotification` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionModeSpokenAudio` | `AVAudioSessionModeSpokenAudio` | 7.0 cache, 12.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioSessionModeVoicePrompt` | `AVAudioSessionModeVoicePrompt` | 7.0 cache, 12.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioSessionPortCarAudio` | `CarAudio` | 7.0 cache, 12.0 cache, host |
| `AVAudioSessionPortAVB` | `AVB` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionPortDisplayPort` | `DisplayPort` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionPortFireWire` | `FireWire` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionPortPCI` | `PCI` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionPortThunderbolt` | `Thunderbolt` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionPortVirtual` | `Virtual` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionPortContinuityMicrophone` | `ContinuityMicrophone` | host |
| `AVAudioApplicationMuteStateKey` | `AVAudioApplicationMuteStateKey` | host |
| `AVAudioApplicationInputMuteStateChangeNotification` | `AVAudioApplicationInputMuteStateChangeNotification` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionModeShortFormVideo` | `AVAudioSessionModeShortFormVideo` | host |
| `AVAudioSessionModeDualRoute` | `AVAudioSessionModeDualRoute` | host |

`AVAudioSessionModeShortFormVideo` and `AVAudioSessionModeDualRoute` are the two modes no held cache
has. The 26.2 header dates them at **26.0** and **26.2** respectively, and the newest 64-bit cache
on this machine is 18.0, so neither can be in it - confirmed, with `AVAudioSessionModeVoicePrompt`
and five other modes as the controls in the same call, by `dyld.load` over 16.0 and 18.0
(`.agent-work/plan-and-analysis/avfaudio/whoknows.lua`): six of the eight mode strings are exported
and those two are not. Their values are therefore the host's own AVFAudio's, read with `dlsym`
(`.agent-work/plan-and-analysis/avfaudio/probe4.c`, log `hostmodes.log`), where
`AVAudioSessionModeDefault` and `AVAudioSessionModeVoicePrompt` are read in the same call as the
controls. Both answer with the constant's own name, which is the shape every mode string that *is*
readable out of a cache answers with. Each is in an object file of its own, because an object is
carried from one release on and 26.0 is not 26.2.

The five names of iOS 18.2 and later (`AVAudioApplicationMuteStateKey`,
`AVAudioApplicationInputMuteStateChangeNotification`) are readable only from the host, because 18.2
is a release no cache is held for and 18.0 is the earliest that has them. Their shape - the
constant's own name - is the shape AVFAudio uses for a notification and a userInfo key, and
`AVAudioUnitComponentTagsDidChangeNotification` and `AVAudioSessionModeVoicePrompt`, read out of a
cache, are that same shape; the host's answers agree with both.
