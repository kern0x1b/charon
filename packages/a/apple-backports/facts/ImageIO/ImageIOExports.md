# ImageIO and CoreVideo names the release already exports

The SDK dates many ImageIO and CoreVideo names after iOS 6, and asked one by one with `dlsym`,
iOS 6 exports a few of them. They are the release's own and are not carried here, and the rest are absent.

Source: an iPad 2 running 6.1.3 and the iOS 6.0 emulator, which agree.

## What the release exports

`CGImageSourceCopyMetadataAtIndex`, the eight `kCGImageMetadataNamespace...` names of Exif, ExifAux,
DublinCore, IPTCCore, Photoshop, TIFF, XMPBasic and XMPRights, `kCGImagePropertyPNGCompressionFilter` and
`kCGImageSourceSubsampleFactor`. What they do was not compared with a newer release: the names
are exported, which is what an application that links against them needs, and nothing more is claimed.

The rest of the metadata API of ImageIO (`CGImageMetadata...`, `CGImageDestination...Metadata...`) and the
other names of ImageIO and CoreVideo that arrived after iOS 6 are not exported, so a weak reference to them is
NULL, and the registry records them as absent.
