# The sixteen rows of iOS 8.0's corpus this group registers `absent`, and what each one is measured to be

Sixteen rows of `registry/HealthKit/ios8.json` sit at `absent`: the eight `-init` methods of the classes
whose header marks them unavailable, the four workout-session methods of `HKHealthStore`, and the four
states-of-mind predicates of `HKQuery`. This file is what each of the sixteen is, measured, with the
command behind every number — because a row that names a measurement without the command is an
assertion, and these rows' `source` named only the SDK's own header.

**This file covers the eight method rows** — the workout-session methods and the states-of-mind
predicates. The eight `-init` rows are in §4, below, and what a caller gets of them is the one thing in
this file still open.

**No row changed status.** `absent` is the right verdict for all sixteen and none of them can be
`implemented`: `implemented` needs a definition the band exports, and the port declares no
workout-session method and no states-of-mind predicate. What changed is that each row now says what it
is, and each said something weaker than the measurement.

**The reader, and its control, once.** Every path in the output quoted below is written `$HOME` where
the run prints this machine's own home; the run prints the absolute cache it read, and that is the one
thing in it a repository may not carry. Everything in sections 1 to 4 is read by

```
CHARON_ROOT="$PWD" xmake l packages/a/apple-backports/facts/HealthKit/rows-code-map.lua 8.0 6.1.3 4.3 9.0 18.0
```

through `modules/apple/objc.lua`'s `code_map()`, which gives every method a rung declares as
`{owner, is_class_method, selector, imp, category}` — so an answer can say **which class** declares a
selector, whether it is a class method, and whether the class declares it of its own or a category adds
it. `objc.inventory()` cannot: its `method_list()` keys *both* of a class's method lists with a leading
`-` and nothing says whether an entry came from the class or from a category. That is not a
hypothetical: a first differential built on `inventory()` answered `no` for all sixteen owners **and
`no` for all sixteen controls**, and could not tell a real zero from a blind reader, so it reported
`CONTROL FAILED` and no row was written from it. The count beside every answer in the output is that
control, and the last line of each rung says what it was:

   control: every owner class this rung holds declares methods of its own
```

`own-methods-of-owner=54` is the control reading out loud: HKQuery *does* declare 54 methods of its own
in that cache, so a `no` beside it is about the selector and not about the reader. The eight `-init` rows
are in the same table for completeness — they are the subject of §4.

## 1. Both band ends

`modules/apple/backports.lua`'s `band_ranges()` checks a band against the **first and last release of
its range**, so the 8.0 band is checked against the port's deployment release and against the last held
release before the next band point. Neither carries any of these sixteen names, and neither carries the
framework at all:

```
== 6.1.3  armv7  $HOME/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7
   524 images, 206216 methods
   ... all sixteen: NOT DECLARED BY THIS CLASS, own-methods-of-owner=0
   anywhere <each of the eight selectors>  no class in this rung
   this rung holds none of: HKCategorySample, HKHealthStore, HKObject, HKObjectType, HKQuantity, HKQuery,
                            HKSource, HKStatistics, HKStatisticsCollection, HKWorkoutEvent
```

and the same for 4.3 (354 images, 123684 methods). That last line is the honest form of the zero on
those two rungs: **the ten owner classes are not there**, which is a different statement from "this
reader cannot see them", and the tool now says which of the two it is instead of printing a control that
is vacuously true when no class was found at all.

## 2. The four states-of-mind rows: iOS 18's, and 18.0 is the only rung that has them

`+[HKQuery predicateForStatesOfMindWithValence:operatorType:]`, `-predicateForStatesOfMindWithKind:`,
`-predicateForStatesOfMindWithLabel:` and `-predicateForStatesOfMindWithAssociation:`. The SDK header
leaves all four unannotated, inside `@interface HKQuery (HKStateOfMind)`, so the corpus dated them from
the class — its `via=class-floor` — and filed them under 8.0. They are not 8.0's, and the old reason
("no release from 8.0 to 10.0 carries it") named a range where a measurement names an owner.

```
$ python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py --rungs predicateForStatesOfMindWithKind:
predicateForStatesOfMindWithKind:	18.0

$ python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py --rungs HKStateOfMind
HKStateOfMind	18.0
```

18.0 is the **first and the only** held rung carrying any of the four, and `rows-code-map.lua` says who
declares them there:

```
== 18.0  arm64e  $HOME/.charon/dyld/18.0/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e
   3692 images, 2896455 methods
   +HKQuery                predicateForStatesOfMindWithValence:operatorType:  own-methods-of-owner=155    own in /System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/HealthKit
   +HKQuery                predicateForStatesOfMindWithKind:               own-methods-of-owner=155    own in /System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/HealthKit
   +HKQuery                predicateForStatesOfMindWithLabel:              own-methods-of-owner=155    own in /System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/HealthKit
   +HKQuery                predicateForStatesOfMindWithAssociation:        own-methods-of-owner=155    own in /System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/HealthKit
   anywhere predicateForStatesOfMindWithValence:operatorType:  +HKQuery predicateForStatesOfMindWithValence:operatorType: [own]
   control: every owner class this rung holds declares methods of its own
```

**`own`, not a category** — worth saying, because the release-split script's own blind-spot note is that
a category's methods compile to no nm-visible symbol and a category is the usual reason a method list
cannot be attributed. These four are HKQuery's own. And they are absent from 8.0, from 9.0 (HKQuery
declares 75 methods of its own there and not these), and from every rung in between: the reader above
reports `no class in this rung` for all four on 8.0 and 9.0.

## 3. The four workout-session rows: watchOS's surface, and the strings are in iOS caches anyway

`-[HKHealthStore startWorkoutSession:]`, `-endWorkoutSession:`, `-pauseWorkoutSession:`,
`-resumeWorkoutSession:`. The header settles what they are, one line each
(`System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/Headers/HKHealthStore.h`, lines 305, 314, 323, 332):

```
- (void)startWorkoutSession:(HKWorkoutSession *)workoutSession API_DEPRECATED("Use HKWorkoutSession's start method", watchos(2.0, 5.0)) API_UNAVAILABLE(ios, macCatalyst, macos);
- (void)endWorkoutSession:(HKWorkoutSession *)workoutSession API_DEPRECATED("Use HKWorkoutSession's end method", watchos(2.0, 5.0)) API_UNAVAILABLE(ios, macCatalyst, macos);
- (void)pauseWorkoutSession:(HKWorkoutSession *)workoutSession API_DEPRECATED("Use HKWorkoutSession's pause method", watchos(3.0, 5.0)) API_UNAVAILABLE(ios);
- (void)resumeWorkoutSession:(HKWorkoutSession *)workoutSession API_DEPRECATED("Use HKWorkoutSession's resume method", watchos(3.0, 5.0)) API_UNAVAILABLE(ios);
```

Two are **of watchOS 2.0** and two of **watchOS 3.0**, all four **deprecated from watchOS 5.0**, all four
`API_UNAVAILABLE(ios)`. That is more than the rows said: the old reason was "the watch application and
app extensions both arrived after this release", which is true and says nothing about which release the
API belongs to.

**And the strings are in iOS caches, which is why the reason was rewritten instead of trusted.** A
selector's rung says nothing about its own owner, so both questions were asked:

```
$ python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py startWorkoutSession: endWorkoutSession: pauseWorkoutSession: resumeWorkoutSession: HKWorkoutSession
startWorkoutSession:	9.0
endWorkoutSession:	9.0
pauseWorkoutSession:	10.0.1
resumeWorkoutSession:	10.0.1
HKWorkoutSession	9.0

$ python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py --rungs startWorkoutSession:
startWorkoutSession:	9.0,9.0.2,9.1,9.2,9.2.1,9.3,9.3.5,9.3.6,10.0.1,10.1.1,10.2,10.2.1,10.3,10.3.1,10.3.2,10.3.3,10.3.4,11.0,12.0,16.0,18.0
```

**Control for this reader, in the same run**, because a `NONE` and a broken index look the same:

```
$ printf '%s\n' predicateForObjectsFromWorkout: predicateForSamplesWithStartDate:endDate:options: \
      zzNoSuchCharonSelectorControl: | python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py
predicateForObjectsFromWorkout:	8.0
predicateForSamplesWithStartDate:endDate:options:	8.0
zzNoSuchCharonSelectorControl:	NONE
```

Two HealthKit class methods of 8.0 read 8.0 and a nonsense name reads `NONE`, so the index sees
HealthKit's own selectors and the rungs above are the ladder's and not the reader's.

So the absence is **not** "the image has no such string". `rows-code-map.lua` says which class, on
which rung:

```
== 9.0  armv7  $HOME/.charon/dyld/9.0/dyld_shared_cache_armv7
   905 images, 515998 methods
   -HKHealthStore          startWorkoutSession:                            own-methods-of-owner=155    own in /System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/HealthKit
   -HKHealthStore          endWorkoutSession:                              own-methods-of-owner=155    own in /System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/HealthKit
   -HKHealthStore          pauseWorkoutSession:                            own-methods-of-owner=155    NOT DECLARED BY THIS CLASS
   -HKHealthStore          resumeWorkoutSession:                           own-methods-of-owner=155    NOT DECLARED BY THIS CLASS
   anywhere startWorkoutSession:                            -HKHealthStore startWorkoutSession: [own]
   anywhere pauseWorkoutSession:                            no class in this rung
   control: every owner class this rung holds declares methods of its own

== 18.0  arm64e  $HOME/.charon/dyld/18.0/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e
   -HKHealthStore          pauseWorkoutSession:                            own-methods-of-owner=283    own in /System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/HealthKit
   -HKHealthStore          resumeWorkoutSession:                           own-methods-of-owner=283    own in /System/Library/Frameworks/HealthKit.framework/HealthKit
   anywhere endWorkoutSession:                              -CMWorkoutManager endWorkoutSession: [own], -HKHealthStore endWorkoutSession: [own]
   control: every owner class this rung holds declares methods of its own
```

Three facts out of that, each of which the old reason did not have:

1. **8.0 has none of the four.** Its `HKHealthStore` declares 95 methods of its own and not one of
   these, and no class of the 8.0 cache declares them anywhere. So this file, the surface of 8.0, is
   right that they are not 8.0's — and it is now measured rather than asserted.
2. **`startWorkoutSession:` and `endWorkoutSession:` are 9.0's**, HKHealthStore's own from that rung.
   **`pauseWorkoutSession:` and `resumeWorkoutSession:` are 10.0.1's** — 9.0 does not have them at all,
   on any class. The four are therefore two releases apart and the rows now say which is which, where
   before all four shared one sentence.
3. **`-endWorkoutSession:` has a second owner.** In 18.0 `CMWorkoutManager` declares it too, which is
   the concrete case of the rulebook's warning that a selector's rung is not an owner: a first-rung
   answer of 9.0 for `endWorkoutSession:` says nothing about whether it is HealthKit's.

## What a caller gets of these eight

Methods no iOS release may call, or only from 9.0 and 10.0.1 onwards: this port declines all eight and
`respondsToSelector:` answers NO, which is what their `effect` says and is now measured on both halves
of the differential rather than asserted. Nothing else in this file is claimed about them.
