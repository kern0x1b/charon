# The `sec_identity_t` family, and what the host case does and does not measure

Six rows in two objects, and the split is `release-split`'s, not mine: run on the pair as one object it
reported `MIXED-RELEASES 12.0,16.0`, with `sec_identity_access_certificates` first appearing at **16.0**
and the other five at **12.0**. One release per object, so `SecObjectWrappersIdentity12_0.m` and
`SecObjectWrappersIdentity16_0.m`, plus `SecProtocolOptionsLocalIdentity.m` for the options setter.

**None of the six is exported by 6.1.3.** Read from that release's own cache — the Security image at
`0x32e79000`, UUID `FBC24F15BD9E37539CDD6E3576BDE938`, 660 exports — `_sec_identity_create`,
`_sec_identity_create_with_certificates`, `_sec_identity_copy_ref`,
`_sec_identity_copy_certificates_ref`, `_sec_identity_access_certificates` and
`_sec_protocol_options_set_local_identity` are all absent. The port supplies them. What the release does
have is `SecIdentityRef`, which is old, and that is the type they wrap.

## The stand-in, and the limit it puts on every row

**A real `SecIdentityRef` cannot be made on this Mac.** Every factory in `SecIdentity.h` is `__IPHONE_NA`
on iOS — `SecIdentityCreateWithCertificate` at `:65`, the preference, preferred and system-identity calls
at `:126`, `:150`, `:174` — and `SecIdentityCreate`, the one taking a key or a certificate directly, **is
not declared at all**.

So the host case passes an **ephemeral in-memory `CFDataRef`** where a `SecIdentityRef` would go, and
every row says so. **No keychain is touched** by anything here: no `SecItemAdd`, no `SecItemDelete`, no
query, no identity import, on this Mac or anywhere.

**A real identity is a GUEST MEASUREMENT and is owed.** What the case measures is the wrapper's
**ownership** — the part that can be wrong — and not the interaction with a real identity.

## What is measured, and the three mutations that prove it

Eleven assertions, and each mutation names the row it breaks:

| assertion | what it holds down | mutant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `copy-ref-same` | copy_ref answers the ref it was given, by pointer | — |
| `certificates-copied`, `copy-survives-source-change` | the array is **copied**, not aliased | aliasing it → `copy-survives-source-change: got 0` |
| `access-true`, `handler-runs-per-certificate` | the handler runs once per certificate | never calling it → `handler-runs-per-certificate: got 0` |
| `access-empty-true`, `handler-runs-on-empty` | true, having run the handler zero times | — |
| `copy_ref-of-nil` | a nil identity is refused, as `_Nullable` says | — |
| `local-identity-holds` | the options object holds and reads back the identity | — |
| the retain balance | — | dropping the `+1` → `access-empty-true: got 0` |

The two objects the case links: `SecObjectWrappersIdentity12_0.m` holds `CharonSecIdentity`, and
`SecObjectWrappersIdentity16_0.m` holds the accessor and **declares** that class without implementing it —
a second `@implementation` would be a duplicate definition, and there is none.

## Two things the compiler taught, both about types

`sec_identity_t` is emitted as `NSObject<OS_sec_identity> * __attribute__((objc_independent_class))`, so
it is an **Objective-C pointer**: it takes a `__strong` ivar directly and passing it to a method of the
same type needs no cast. A `SecIdentityRef` is a `CFTypeRef` and cannot be `__strong` — ARC warns that it
will not manage one. And a case must **declare** the port classes it names, because they are implemented
in `.m` files it does not include.
