# Why Network's floor is iOS 6.0

Every type of Network's C API is an `OS_OBJECT` type: `nw_endpoint_t`, `nw_connection_t`,
`nw_parameters_t` and the rest are `OS_OBJECT_DECL`, which `nw_object.h:32` defines in terms of
`OS_OBJECT_DECL` - a protocol plus a typedef of `NSObject` to that protocol. The port's objects are
`NSObject`s that adopt those protocols, so a release where the object types are not Objective-C
objects has nothing for them to be.

The release decides that, and the SDK says so itself in `usr/include/os/object.h:67`:

```c
#elif TARGET_OS_IOS && __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED < __IPHONE_6_0
#  define OS_OBJECT_HAVE_OBJC_SUPPORT 0
```

and `OS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC` follows it (`object.h:81-93`): with no Objective-C support the whole family
is 0, so under a deployment target below iOS 6.0 `nw_endpoint_t` is not an `NSObject` protocol
type at all. That is the same measured reason ARKit, Vision and CoreML already sit at 6.0 on this
port.

So **every entry in `registry/Network/` carries `minimum: 6.0`**, the 4.3 band leaves the library
out with the usual note, and nothing of Network is compiled for 4.3 - including the connection
object api-upstreams brought, which is told the same in the delivery note.

`SSLCreateContext` being iOS 5.0 API is therefore moot for this port: the TLS of a connection is
never reached on a release that has no Network.
