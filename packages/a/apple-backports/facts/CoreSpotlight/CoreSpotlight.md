# CoreSpotlight, iOS 9

`CSSearchableIndex`, `CSSearchableItem`, `CSSearchableItemAttributeSet`, `CSSearchableItemActionType`
and `CSSearchableItemActivityIdentifier` are strong-imported LOAD-FAIL symbols for provenance and
telegram, two applications of the corpus. A hard-linked class or C symbol that is absent kills the
application at launch — dyld fails to bind the non-weak import — so the classes and constants are
carried, not marked absent.

The functions live in `libCoreSpotlightBackports.dylib`, built with the `corespotlight` config,
because CoreSpotlight is the only framework it loads besides Foundation.

## The earlier verdict, retracted

An earlier pass of this port answered every write with `CSIndexErrorCodeIndexingUnsupported` and
called `isIndexingAvailable` a `documented-absent` seam, on the reasoning that iOS 6.1.3's own
`SPSpotlightManager` is a pull model and `CSSearchableIndex` is a push model, and bridging one onto
the other would be guessing at an undocumented private protocol. That reasoning does not hold: a
private, undocumented protocol is work, not a wall, the same way the Swift runtime and Metal-over-ES2
were work. The write seam is reversible, and this pass reverses it.

## What the device has

An iPhone 4S and an iPad 2 on iOS 6.1.3 have no CoreSpotlight framework and no on-device Spotlight
index an application can write to in Apple's own sense of the word. What they do have:

- `Spotlight.framework` (`/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Spotlight.framework/Spotlight`), a
  private framework carrying exactly one Objective-C class, `SPSpotlightManager`. Its full method
  and property list, read from `__objc_methname`/`__objc_classname` of the extracted binary:
  `init`, `dealloc`, `alloc`, `+sharedConnection`, `+defaultManager`, `+sharedManager`,
  `-startRecordUpdatesForApplication:andCategory:`, `-endRecordUpdatesForApplication:andCategory:`,
  `-requestRecordUpdatesForApplication:category:andIDs:`,
  `-_processIdentifiers:forApplication:andCategory:`, `-notifyIndexer`,
  `-appModifiedRecordIDs:forCategory:`, `-application:modifiedRecordIDs:forCategory:`,
  `-eraseIndexForApplication:category:`, plus the record-field names `_displayID`, `external_id`,
  `title`, `subtitle`, `summary`, `aux_title`, `aux_subtitle`, `category`, `content`. Objective-C
  type encodings confirm two-object-argument methods (`v16@0:4@8@12`, e.g.
  `startRecordUpdatesForApplication:andCategory:`) and three-object-argument methods
  (`v20@0:4@8@12@16`, e.g. `application:modifiedRecordIDs:forCategory:`); every argument is `@`
  (an object), so no primitive width can be wrong at the `objc_msgSend` boundary. `__text` is 0x1d4
  bytes: most of these selectors are thin forwarders to two shared internal C entry points at
  `0x366a1d78`/`0x366a1d88`, so the substantive per-selector logic (how a category's registration is
  kept, how a pull answer is actually assembled from the `_displayID`/`title`/... record fields)
  lives past those stubs and was not traced further — the class surface, not the control flow inside
  it, is what this port bridges to.
- `Search.framework` (`/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Search.framework/Search`), which owns
  `-_loadSearchBundles`, backed by `-contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:error:` reading each bundle's
  `principalClass` — a real directory scan, not a hardcoded table.
- Exactly eleven search bundles on the device, all Apple's own, found by listing the shared cache:
  `/System/Library/SearchBundles/{AddressBook,Application,Extended,MobileCal,MobileMail,MobileNotes,
  Reminders,TopHits,VoiceMemos,iPod}.searchBundle` and
  `/System/Library/Spotlight/SearchBundles/SMSSearch.searchBundle`. None of them is a general,
  per-installed-app entry point.
- `Application.searchBundle`'s own extracted binary names its source file as
  `SPApplicationDatastore.m` and carries the string `categoryForDomain:` — it matches installed
  application names on its own, independent of `SPSpotlightManager`'s category registration.

Confirmed by extracting both frameworks and both search bundles named above out of the armv7 shared
cache of iOS 6.1.3 with `modules/apple/dyld.lua`'s `extract` and reading their `__objc_methname`,
`__objc_classname` and `__cstring` sections with `strings`/`otool -l`; `CSSearchable`,
`MobileSpotlight` and `CoreSpotlight` are exported by none of the release's images at all.

## The `extract` bug this pass fixed

`modules/apple/dyld.lua`'s `extract` failed with `bad argument #2 to 'pack' (unsigned overflow)` on
`Spotlight.framework`, and would fail identically on any image whose `LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY` carries a
zero-length field (`weak_bind_size` or similar) at a nonzero offset. The bounds pass that computes
`first`/`last` (and so the relocation `shift`) already excludes zero-length fields
(`if offset > 0 and length > 0`); the rewrite pass that applies `shift` did not, so a zero-length
field's stale, out-of-[first,last) offset was shifted into a huge negative number and handed to
`string.pack("<I4", ...)`. Fixed by applying the same `length > 0` guard on the write side; a
zero-length field is written back as `0`, since nothing ever reads at it. Verified by re-extracting
`Spotlight.framework` (previously a hard failure) and cross-checking the rebuilt Mach-O header's
segment/symtab/dysymtab bounds against the file size in Python — all within range, unlike the earlier
attempt's `183410688 + (8192 - 187111415) = -3692535`.

## What the port does

`CSSearchableIndex` keeps its own journal: a `CharonSpotlightStore` per index name, a property-list
of archived `CSSearchableItem`s and the batch client state, under Application Support at
`space.kern0x1b.corespotlight/<name>.plist`. `indexSearchableItems:completionHandler:` and the three
delete methods write or remove entries and call their handler with a `nil` error — a real journal, not
a `documented-absent` refusal — and `endIndexBatchWithClientState:completionHandler:` /
`fetchLastClientStateWithCompletionHandler:` persist and return the client state exactly as the
header describes, including refusing batching on `defaultSearchableIndex`. `isIndexingAvailable`
answers `YES`: the index genuinely indexes.

Every mutation also calls `CharonSpotlightBridge`, which `dlopen`s `Spotlight.framework`,
resolves `SPSpotlightManager` and `+sharedManager` with `NSClassFromString`/`objc_msgSend`, registers
the index's category (the application's own bundle identifier) with
`-startRecordUpdatesForApplication:andCategory:`, and on each write pushes the changed identifiers
with `-requestRecordUpdatesForApplication:category:andIDs:` followed by `-notifyIndexer`. Every call
is guarded by `respondsToSelector:` and wrapped in `@try`/`@catch`, off the main thread, so an
unexpected private-framework surface can never turn into a fatal error for the host application: this
is the honest bridge to the private class, not a fabricated success.

## What is not proven

`SPSpotlightManager`'s registration and push calls were exercised against a private class whose
control-flow past the two shared stub entry points was not traced, so whether the manager journals a
category it has never seen from a first-party bundle, and whether the `_displayID`/`title`/... record
fields need to accompany the pushed identifiers for the pull side to answer anything, are both
unmeasured on-device. What is measured and closes the loop regardless of that answer: even a
perfectly accepted registration cannot reach the user, because the system's own search surface is the
fixed eleven-bundle list above, none of which reads a third-party category, and
`Application.searchBundle` (the one bundle that does look at installed apps) bypasses
`SPSpotlightManager` entirely.

**The twelfth entry named above is built and installed; the query path is not proven yet, and
exactly how far it gets is now measured on an iPad 2 (6.1.3), not guessed.**
`packages/a/apple-backports/CoreSpotlight/SearchBundle/CharonSearchDatastore.m` is
`org.charon.corespotlight.searchBundle`'s principal class, packaged by `write_searchbundle` in
`modules/apple/backports.lua` and installed at
`/System/Library/SearchBundles/org.charon.corespotlight.searchBundle/` by the same `.deb` this
port already writes, whenever `corespotlight` is among the staged libraries. The protocol it
implements was read from `NotesDatastore` (`MobileNotes.searchBundle`'s own principal class) with
`llvm-otool -oV` and each selector resolved against the iOS 6.1.3 shared cache directly
(`.agent-work/handoffs/2026-09-23-corespotlight-searchbundle-measurement.md`), which corrected two
selector names an earlier `strings`-only pass got wrong (`-categoryForDomain:` and
`-wantsEveryResultInItsOwnSection` are not implemented by `NotesDatastore` at all - the real
required methods are `-displayIdentifierForDomain:`, `-searchDomains` and
`-performQuery:withResultsPipe:`). `-performQuery:withResultsPipe:` filters every app's stored
items (case-insensitive substring match against `attributeSet.title` - the only field this
port's `CSSearchableItemAttributeSet` actually backs; `.contentDescription` was assumed present
from the real CoreSpotlight API and found, on device, to raise `NSUnknownKeyException` instead of
answering `nil` - corrected before it ever shipped a crash) and
pushes matches through `-[resultsPipe addResults:]`, the way `NotesDatastore` itself does.

This forced a real correction to `CSSearchableIndex` itself:
`CharonSpotlightStoreDirectory` wrote under `NSApplicationSupportDirectory`, sandboxed to the
indexing application's own container - a location no search bundle, running in whatever process
hosts system search, could ever read. It now writes under
`/var/mobile/Library/Caches/org.charon.corespotlight/<bundle identifier>/`, world-readable
(`0777`), the same shared-cache bridge pattern `org.charon.callkit` already uses to cross the same
kind of process boundary. `CharonSearchDatastore.m` resolves `CSSearchableItem` - this port's own
class, not Apple's, so no compile-time link is possible - by `dlopen`ing the installed
`libCoreSpotlightBackports.dylib` symlink before unarchiving, and every value that crosses that
boundary is typed `id` and read with `valueForKey:`, never a static `CSSearchableItem *`, since
this bundle is built once, not per band.

## Measured on device 2026-09-23 (iPad 2, 6.1.3): the two questions this was all built to answer

**Does the search host re-read `/System/Library/SearchBundles/` without a reboot? Yes, measured, not
assumed - there is no persistent daemon to be stale.** `com.apple.searchd`
(`/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Search.framework/searchd`) is a launchd on-demand service with
no `KeepAlive`: nothing has it loaded until the first client connects, it exits again once idle, and
each cold start is confirmed by its PID changing between runs (`ps ax`) after `kill -9`ing it. A
`SPSearchAgent` created from a standalone diagnostic process (`tests/backports/device/searchbundle-probe.m`)
drove a real query through this real daemon and got real
results back for Apple's own built-in bundles (`com.apple.MobileAddressBook`: 3, `com.apple.AppStore`:
1, for the query `"a"`) - proving the whole `SPSearchAgent` → XPC → `searchd` → `-_loadSearchBundles`
→ datastore → `SPSearchResultSection` pipeline is real and working end to end, and that a freshly
installed or updated bundle is live the moment the next connection cold-starts `searchd` - no respring,
no reboot, structurally, because there is nothing long-lived to go stale.

**Does a real query reach `-performQuery:withResultsPipe:`? Not yet - genuine progress, an honest
boundary, not a guess dressed as a result.** Getting this far took three more real, on-device-only
bugs, each found by a failure this port could not have predicted from host-only reading:

1. **`Info.plist` used the wrong keys.** The host-only pass read `principalClass` (lowercase) from a
   `strings` fragment - "unable to load search bundle... principal cl[ass...]" - and wrote that as a
   literal plist key, the same trap as the `-categoryForDomain:` mistake in the same document,
   applied to a plist key this time instead of a selector name. `MobileNotes.searchBundle`'s own
   `Info.plist`, fetched and read directly, uses `NSExecutable`/`NSPrincipalClass` (standard
   `NSBundle` keys) and carries no `CFBundleExecutable` at all. `[NSBundle loadAndReturnError:]`
   answered `NSCocoaErrorDomain` code 3588 ("couldn't be loaded") against the wrong keys; fixed by
   matching the real bundle's keys exactly.
2. **The compiled bundle referenced `_objc_alloc` and `___NSArray0__`, neither exported by iOS
   6.1.3.** Both are modern-runtime fast-path symbols ARC's codegen substitutes for ordinary
   patterns - `[[X alloc] init]`/bare `[X alloc]` for the first, the empty array literal `@[]` for
   the second - when the compile target implies a new-enough runtime, which `-target
   armv7-apple-ios9.0` (used to route around a `libarclite` requirement at lower targets, same as
   `tests/backports/device/cellulardata.m` this session) does. `dlopen`'s own `dlerror()` named the
   exact missing symbol directly - a far better signal than `NSBundle`'s generic "couldn't be
   loaded". Fixed by replacing `@[]` with `[NSArray array]` throughout; the earlier
   `CTCellularData9.m`/device-test precedent for `_objc_alloc` already established the same fix
   for `alloc`/`init`.
3. **`SPSearchDatastore` is a protocol, not a class - `NotesDatastore` does not subclass a class of
   that name.** `NSClassFromString(@"SPSearchDatastore")` answers `nil`; the code silently fell back
   to a bare `NSObject` subclass, which loaded and registered without error but which `searchd`
   never asked anything of - no crash, no log, `-searchDomains` simply never called, indistinguishable
   from the bundle not existing at all. `macho.imported_symbols` on `MobileNotes`'s own extracted
   binary names exactly one `SP`-prefixed class import, `SPContentResult`; NotesDatastore's real
   inheritance is `SPContentResult <SPSearchDatastore>`, class and protocol two different names
   sharing no relationship the earlier reading assumed. Fixed by subclassing `SPContentResult`.

## Measured 2026-09-23, second pass: `SPContentResult` found by reading the classlist, not guessing

**Boundary crossed, not intermediate: `searchd` now calls into this bundle's own methods for real.**
The first device pass ended with `searchd` never calling `-searchDomains`/`-performQuery:withResultsPipe:`
on the registered class at all - that is now fixed and confirmed: both are called, `-performQuery:withResultsPipe:`
receives a real query, correctly reads its `searchString`, and correctly builds a real `SPContentResult`
carrying the synthetic item's exact title. `resultsPipe respondsToSelector:@selector(appendResults:)`
answers `YES`. Whatever remains is entirely about the one call at the end of this chain, not about
whether the bundle is reachable at all - record it as crossed so the next pass does not re-prove it.

A note on the method that found `SPContentResult`, since the instruction that produced it was itself
based on an assumption worth naming: the coordinator's own suggestion was to find the image that
*exports* `_OBJC_CLASS_$_SPContentResult`. Nothing exports it - `macho.imported_symbols`, which reads
the export trie, found nothing, and following that instruction literally would have answered
"defined nowhere", a sixth wrong fact in this chain. **A class can be defined and never exported**;
the ObjC runtime reads class definitions from `__objc_classlist`, a section a linker's export trie
has no reason to include, since nothing outside the image references the class by its mangled
`_OBJC_CLASS_$_` symbol directly - only `objc_getClass`/`NSClassFromString` reach it, at runtime, by
name. `apple.objc.inventory()` walks `__objc_classlist` across the whole cache directly, which is why
it found what the export-trie read could not.

Answer: `SPContentResult` is defined in `Search.framework` itself, the file already extracted this
session - superclass `SPSearchResult`, superclass of that `PBCodable`, and no overridden `-init`
anywhere in the chain, so the "unmeasured initialization contract" this document named as the
boundary after the first device pass was the wrong hypothesis. The real blockers, found one at a
time as each was fixed:

1. **`objc_allocateClassPair` over `SPContentResult` does not itself grant `<SPSearchDatastore>`
   conformance.** `NotesDatastore` gets it from its own `@interface` declaration; `class_addMethod`
   alone does not reproduce that. This is the exact same gap this pass had already found and fixed
   on the delegate side (`SPDaemonQueryDelegate`, `class_addProtocol` in
   `tests/backports/device/searchbundle-probe.m`) - applying the identical fix to the datastore
   class itself (`class_addProtocol(cls, objc_getProtocol("SPSearchDatastore"))`) is what made
   `searchd` call `-searchDomains` and `-performQuery:withResultsPipe:` for the first time. Confirmed
   by the file log the class itself writes (see below): `searchDomains called`, then, once the query
   agent's domain list was extended to include this datastore's own declared domain,
   `performQuery:withResultsPipe:` too.
2. **The `resultsPipe` parameter is not a separate object and not an `SPSearchResultSection`.**
   Logging its `-description` showed the exact same pointer as `query` - it is the query object
   itself, an `SDSearchQuery`. That class is not in the shared cache at all (`apple.objc.inventory()`
   found nothing under that name); it is defined in `searchd`'s own executable, fetched and read
   directly with `llvm-otool -oV`. Its real, required protocol is `<SPSearchResultsPipe>`, and the
   push method is `-appendResults:` (`v12@0:4@8`) - not `-addResults:`, which is a real method of the
   unrelated `SPSearchResultSection` that happened to share a name and a shape, the exact mechanism
   that makes a wrong name look plausible. Fixed by sending `-appendResults:` instead.
3. **The result factory is `SPContentResult`'s own class method, not `SPSearchResult`'s.** The first
   device pass attributed `+resultWithIdentifier:title:subtitle:summary:auxiliaryTitle:auxiliarySubtitle:actionURL:searchableContent:`
   to `SPSearchResult` (repeating the original, pre-device `strings`-based session's claim
   unchecked); `apple.objc.inventory()`'s classlist read shows it is `SPContentResult`'s own class
   method - `SPSearchResult` only happens to be `SPContentResult`'s superclass. `SPSearchResult
   respondsToSelector:` answered `NO` for exactly this reason, caught by the file log rather than
   silently returning no results forever.

After all three: the bundle `dlopen`s cleanly, registers as a real `SPContentResult` subclass
conforming to `<SPSearchDatastore>`, `searchd` calls `-searchDomains` and
`-performQuery:withResultsPipe:` for real, `-performQuery:withResultsPipe:` correctly reads the
query's `searchString`, correctly finds the one synthetic item written for this test, and correctly
builds a real `SPContentResult` carrying that exact title - confirmed by the object's own
`-description` in the log: `<SPContentResult: 0x1d59c080> { title = CharonProbeXyzzyPlugh19640523; }`.
`resultsPipe respondsToSelector:@selector(appendResults:)` answers `YES`.

**Sending `-appendResults:` to it hangs `searchd`, and the differentiating experiment names which
of the two candidates it is not.** The call was made; no crash followed, no further log line
(`appendResults: sent`, the line immediately after the send, never appears), and `searchd`'s own
process moved into uninterruptible sleep (`ps` state `U`) and stayed there, unresponsive to a fresh
connection, until killed with `kill -9`. Real, observed, confirmed by waiting past it and
re-checking, not a single snapshot.

`class_copyIvarList` walked across the real chain (`SPContentResult` → `SPSearchResult` →
`PBCodable` → `NSObject`, read directly on device, not guessed from names) found the actual field
set, smaller than assumed: `SPContentResult` itself carries only `_extid`/`_content`
(`-setExtid:`/`-setContent:`); `SPSearchResult` carries `_identifier` (a `Q`/`uint64_t`, not a
string - the factory's `identifier:` argument is presumably hashed into it internally),
`_title`/`_subtitle`/`_summary`/`_auxiliaryTitle`/`_auxiliarySubtitle`/`_url`, and one `_has`
bitfield (`{?="identifier"b1"flags"b1}`) tracking only those two fields as ever-set - both already
set by the real factory this code calls. **There is no `_domain` ivar anywhere in this chain** -
that field belongs to the unrelated `SPSearchResultSection`, so "unset domain" was never a real
candidate; `_extid`/`_content` were the only two fields actually worth filling.

Filled both (`-setExtid:` with the item's own identifier, `-setContent:` with its title, confirmed
in the log immediately before the hang: `extid=org.charon.corespotlight.probe.item1
content=CharonProbeXyzzyPlugh19640523`) and repeated the call on a clean `searchd`
(confirmed not-yet-running before the run, per the coordinator's instruction not to chain
experiments without a health check between them). **The hang still happens, identically** - same
missing `appendResults: sent` line, same `U` state, same unresponsiveness until `kill -9`. This
rules out the missing-field hypothesis directly rather than leaving it open: whatever
`-appendResults:` blocks on, it is not an unset `extid`/`content`/`domain`. The remaining
candidate - `-appendResults:` expecting a call chain or connection state this bundle's
`-performQuery:withResultsPipe:` does not reproduce, most plausibly a `mach_msg` wait on something
this out-of-process caller never supplies - stands as the real boundary, differentiated rather than
assumed. `searchd` was confirmed healthy again after each `kill -9` (a real query against Apple's
own built-in bundles, results returned normally) before the device was released; the bundle itself
was removed before release, since it hangs the host it loads into.

Diagnostics used and their proven channel, since this class runs inside `searchd`, not the process
that launches it: `printf`/`NSLog` to this process's own `stdout`/`stderr` reach nobody - a plain
`fopen`/`fprintf`/`fclose` to a fixed path (`CharonSearchDatastoreLog` in the source) is the channel
proven to survive that boundary, confirmed by lines actually landing on disk after the class
registered successfully. Left in place, gated behind rarely-called methods, for whoever continues
this - it is what caught every finding in this section, including the hang, which produced no
log line of its own but whose absence was exactly the signal.

## What differs from the release

The `Images`, `Media`, `Documents`, `Events`, `Places` and `Messaging` attribute categories and the
custom-key API are not carried: an application that reads or writes one of those properties sends a
message this port does not implement. `indexDelegate` is kept but never messaged: nothing in this
port's own runtime ever loses the journal the way the real index's remote process can, so there is
never a `reindexAllSearchableItemsWithAcknowledgementHandler:`/
`reindexSearchableItemsWithIdentifiers:acknowledgementHandler:` call to make. The two continuation
constants (`CSSearchableItemActionType` = `"com.apple.corespotlightitem"`,
`CSSearchableItemActivityIdentifier` = `"kCSSearchableItemActivityIdentifier"`) are carried at the
release's own values, extracted from `CoreSpotlight` of the arm64 shared cache of iOS 12.0
(`_CSSearchableItemActionType` and `_CSSearchableItemActivityIdentifier`, each a pointer to a
`CFConstantString`, read with `modules/apple/dyld.lua`'s `pointer_at`/`string_at`), but neither is
ever posted by this port: no item of this port's making is ever surfaced by the system's Spotlight
for the user to tap, so the continuation path they describe never runs here — see above for why, and
for what closing that gap actually requires. `CSIndexErrorDomain` = `"CSIndexErrorDomain"`, extracted
the same way.
