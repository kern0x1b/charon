# The whole-cache rung: 6.1.3 read in one pass, 11378 classes and 1171 protocols

Every other page in this folder decides its rows from the MediaPlayer image alone
(`tools/mach32_methods.py` over the image at `0x31fe3000`, 236 classes, 41 categories). That is the right
rung for a member of a MediaPlayer class and it is not enough for two things in this family: a member of a
class MediaPlayer does not own, and a **protocol** — a protocol's absence is a fact about the whole release,
not about one image. This page is the rung that decides those, and it was run once, through
`coordination/heavy.sh`, at a load of 9.08.

```
CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua \
  ~/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7 > inventory-6.1.3.tsv
12549 lines: 11378 classes, 1171 protocols
```

The reader's controls, from the same file: a class no framework has reads absent, and `MPVolumeView` and
`MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` read present.

## What it settles that the per-image read could not

**`AVPlayerItem.nowPlayingInfo` (16.0)** — the member of an AVFoundation class, which is why this row
waited two turns for it. In the whole cache, `AVPlayerItem` lives in `AVFoundation.framework/AVFoundation`
with **237 own instance selectors and 35 own class selectors**:

| selector | in AVPlayerItem's own 237 |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | **yes** |
| `timedMetadata` | **yes** |
| `duration` | **yes** |
| `MPAVItem` | **yes** — the MediaPlayer category's own method |
| `nowPlayingInfo` | **no** |
| `setNowPlayingInfo:` | **no** |

One class, one reader, a YES and a NO: that is the control that makes the NO mean something. And across the
**whole** 6.1.3 cache exactly **two** classes declare `nowPlayingInfo` in their own instance list —
`MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` (MediaPlayer) and `MRMediaRemoteState` (`PrivateFrameworks/MediaRemote`, a private
framework no application links). Neither is `AVPlayerItem`.

The release's whole-cache **selector list** could not have decided this, and this is the second time that
rung has had to be passed over in this family: `nowPlayingInfo` is on **one** of its 113981 distinct names,
because some class somewhere declares it. The per-cache list is a list of names, not of owners.

**Twenty class and protocol rows, absent from the whole release** — not merely from MediaPlayer's image,
which is the stronger claim and needs this rung for a protocol:

`MPAdTimeRange`, `MPContentItem`, `MPNowPlayingSession`, `MPNowPlayingSessionDelegate`,
`MPPlayableContentManager`, `MPPlayableContentManagerContext`, `MPPlayableContentDataSource`,
`MPPlayableContentDelegate`, `MPSystemMusicPlayerController`, `MPMusicPlayerQueueDescriptor`,
`MPMusicPlayerMediaItemQueueDescriptor`, `MPMusicPlayerStoreQueueDescriptor`, `MPMusicPlayerPlayParameters`,
`MPMusicPlayerPlayParametersQueueDescriptor`, `MPMusicPlayerControllerQueue`,
`MPMusicPlayerControllerMutableQueue`, `MPMusicPlayerApplicationController`, `MPMediaPlaylistCreationMetadata`,
`MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOption`, `MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOptionGroup`.

The twenty is the number of NAMES in that list, and the page that lists them is the only place it appears: eleven
classes and four protocols plus five more classes, all read one at a time against the 12549 lines above. A
first draft of this line said sixteen, which is the number of *rows* in the queue those twenty names come
from once the two `MPMusicPlayerControllerQueue` spellings are counted once — a count nobody could recompute,
in a page whose subject is a reader whose whole value is that its numbers can be.

**Every one is new code that cannot shadow anything**, which is what `implemented` over `absent` needs: the
release has no object of that name, so a port class with that name collides with nothing. The 1171 protocol
rows in the file are what make that true for the four protocol rows — a protocol is not a class, its absence
is not visible to a per-image classlist read, and `MPPlayableContentDataSource` and `MPPlayableContentDelegate`
are rows in this family.

## The band that links the one AVFoundation-owned member, and the framework it needs

`AVPlayerItem.nowPlayingInfo` is carried, and it is the only object in `MediaPlayerBackports` whose owner
class is not MediaPlayer's. That makes it the only one whose **link** needs a framework the library did not
name, and the failure is structural rather than a missing import: a category's class reference is a symbol,
so a band that does not carry `AVFoundation` leaves `_OBJC_CLASS_$_AVPlayerItem` undefined and ld fails with
`Undefined symbols for architecture armv7`.

**What the band links is the library's `frameworks` list in `modules/apple/backports.lua`**, filtered per
release by `framework_install_path()`, which links what the band's own first and last release carry at one
install path and prints a note for what they do not. `MediaPlayerBackports` was declared
`{"MediaPlayer", "UIKit", "Foundation"}` - the release's MediaPlayer is a MediaPlayer class library, and
every other object in the folder is a MediaPlayer or UIKit class. **AVFoundation is now in that list**, which
is what binds the category to the release's own AVPlayerItem: `nm -m` on the linked dylib then reads
`(undefined) external _OBJC_CLASS_$_AVPlayerItem (from AVFoundation)`, a bound two-level namespace import
rather than an unresolvable undefined symbol, and that is the shape `check_categories()` accepts. This is
the tree's existing answer and not a new one: `AVKitBackports` declares `AVFoundation` because its
`AVPictureInPictureController.m` holds an `AVPlayerLayer *` that is AVFoundation's (`6e157ef78`), and
`PhotosBackports` and `CallKitBackports` both declare it for objects of theirs that need it.

**What it costs is nothing, and that is measured rather than assumed.** The band links `-framework
MediaPlayer` on every band, so the release's own MediaPlayer is in the process whatever this list says, and
that image already loads AVFoundation:

```
$ otool -L ~/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/MediaPlayer
MediaPlayer:
	/System/Library/Frameworks/MediaPlayer.framework/MediaPlayer (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	... 38 of its 39 LC_LOAD_DYLIB entries elided here; AVFoundation and CoreMotion are its last two ...
	/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/AVFoundation (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 2.0.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreMotion.framework/CoreMotion (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1491.92.0)
```

`~/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/MediaPlayer` is the file 6.1.3 ships **beside** its shared cache - the
`outside_armv7` case `check_band_caches()` names - so this is a read of a release file and not of a cache
image. AVFoundation is one of 39, beside CoreMedia, CoreVideo, CoreGraphics, ImageIO, QuartzCore,
AudioToolbox and MobileCoreServices. So the change is a declaration and not a load: what was missing was the
linker's right to bind `_OBJC_CLASS_$_AVPlayerItem`, not an image.

**What was rejected, and why.** Re-homing the property onto `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` is a change in
behaviour and not a fix: the declaration is
`@property (nonatomic, copy, nullable) NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *nowPlayingInfo` on
`@interface AVPlayerItem (MPAdditions)` in `AVPlayerItem+MPAdditions.h`, MediaPlayer's own header, so a
caller writes `[playerItem setNowPlayingInfo:]` and nothing on `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` would answer it.
`absent` is also wrong here: the release does not carry the accessor (the table above), but the port can,
and `absent` is reserved for a row the release makes impossible.

## The object that is not checked on the host

`AVPlayerItem+NowPlayingInfo16.m` is the one implemented entry of this folder with no differential test
under `tests/backports/host/mediaplayeritem/`, which `packages/a/apple-backports/README.md` asks of every
implemented entry. `run.sh` there builds `probe.m` alone, and the folder's stand-in tree carries MediaPlayer
and UIKit headers but no AVFoundation one, so the stand-in seam the object uses
(`CHARON_MEDIAPLAYER_STANDIN`, which no test in this series defines) is never taken. What it would compare
is the port's own accessor pair against the host's `AVPlayerItem.nowPlayingInfo`, which a Mac's AVFoundation
declares already - the same host-is-not-the-measurement problem `MPMediaItemStandin.h:1-5` records for
`MPMediaItem.albumTrackNumber`, and the same answer: a stand-in build, not the host's framework. That is a
separate unit of work from the link this page's first section is about, and it is not done here.

## One correction this rung caught in my own earlier reading

The inventory's selector columns are **sign-prefixed** — `-nowPlayingInfo`, `+sharedCommandCenter` — not
bare names. A first pass tested membership of the bare name and reported `status`, `externalMetadata` and
`timedMetadata` as absent from `AVPlayerItem` too, which is impossible and was the sign of a broken test
rather than a surprising cache. Stripping the sign gives the table above. A reader that answers NO to
everything would have passed the `nowPlayingInfo` check while being wrong about `status`, and the two
together are what caught it.

## What it does not settle, and the rung that does

- **A member of a MediaPlayer class.** The per-image read is better: it resolves each of the 41 categories'
  **own** class pointer, which is the clobber question a whole-cache merge cannot answer.
- **The value of a named key.** Neither rung reads the value of `MPMediaPlaylistPropertySeedItems`, and the
  port's own keys prove a value cannot be spelled from a name
  (`facts/MediaPlayer/MediaPlayerConstants.md:8-12`). That needs `tools/cfconst.py` against the release that
  first exports the name — a host differential, which is why `MPMediaPlaylist.seedItems` is still on the
  corpus's blanket reason rather than on this page.
- **Whether a release that gates a library gates it.** `MPMediaLibrary93.m` is measured per-image and says
  so; no cache read can say what a 7.0 device would answer.
