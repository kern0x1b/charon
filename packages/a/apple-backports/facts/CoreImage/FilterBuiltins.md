# CIFilter's convenience constructors: the 239 class methods of CIFilterBuiltins.h

iOS 16.0's SDK added a header of its own — `CIFilterBuiltins.h` — that declares, for every built-in filter, a
protocol naming it and a class method on `CIFilter` that takes nothing and answers a filter of that name:
`+ (CIFilter<CISepiaTone*> *) sepiaToneFilter`. Later releases added more of them, and the SDK of 26.2
declares 239. iOS 6 carries none of them: the 6.1.3 armv7 cache's selector table has neither
`sepiaToneFilter` nor `filterWithName:`'s neighbours of that family.

Source: the host's own CoreImage, over every one of the 239, by `tests/backports/host/ciimagefilter`. The test
builds the port's seven objects with their selectors prefixed, links them into one process and asks both
there, so the object compared is the port's own compiled code and not the host's.

## What they are

Each is exactly one call. Measured on the host for all 239:

    compared 478 of 239 port constructors against the host's own, 237 rendered and compared, 0 different

Two comparisons per constructor: the filter the host's `+[CIFilter <selector>]` answers, and the filter the
port's `+charonHost_<selector>` answers. For each pair the class, the `name`, the `inputKeys`, the `outputKeys`
and the whole `attributes` dictionary are equal, and for 237 of the 239 the rendered RGBA bytes over a fixed
32×32 window at the origin are equal too. The window is fixed because a filter whose output is infinite —
every blur — has no extent to render over.

### The inputs a filter is rendered with

Every declared input is given **the value a fresh filter of that name already answers for it**, which is
Apple's own default and not a value the harness chose. The defaults are read before anything is set, because
setting one changes it.

An input whose default is nil has none to read, and what it is comes from the filter's own declaration of it:
the `CIAttributeType` and `CIAttributeClass` its attribute dictionary carries, and for a number the
`CIAttributeMax` and `CIAttributeMin` — or the `CIAttributeSlider*` where there is no other range. Those give:

- an image input: the same synthetic 16×12 image on both sides, except a colour map, which is the host's own
  `CIColorCube` output at the host's own default dimension (a flat image is not a cube, and `CIColorMap`
  answers a nil image for one);
- a rectangle: the synthetic image's own extent, because a rectangle's declared default is `"[0 0 0 0]"` — an
  empty region, over which an area histogram answers a nil image;
- a string, an attributed string or a data: `"charon"` in the form the attribute dictionary declares;
- a number: the range Apple's dictionary declares, largest first, then smallest, then the midpoint of the
  slider range, then 1.

Which end of a range a filter accepts is the filter's own answer and not this harness's: PDF417 refuses at its
own minimum with *"Unable to fit message into space available!"* and draws at its own maximum, and Aztec draws
at its own minimum and nothing at its own maximum. So the harness renders in passes, one candidate per ranged
input per pass, and stops at the first pass where both sides produce an image. Every pass builds both filters
again and gives them the same values, so what is compared on a pass is two filters of the same name with the
same inputs.

### The two it cannot render, and why each is the host refusing

- **`+barcodeGeneratorFilter`** declares one input, `inputBarcodeDescriptor`, of the class
  `CIBarcodeDescriptor`. The host's own `+[CIQRCodeDescriptor descriptorWithPayload:symbolVersion:maskPattern:
  errorCorrectionLevel:]` answers **nil** for every one of the 40 × 8 × 4 combinations its own header's
  ranges allow, measured, because that initializer takes an *error-corrected codeword payload* and not text:
  handing it arbitrary bytes gives it nothing to encode. So there is no descriptor this harness can build
  without implementing QR error correction itself, which is not what it is measuring.
- **`+coreMLModelFilter`** declares `inputModel`, a compiled Core ML model. There is no model to load on the
  machine that runs the harness, and the filter answers a nil image for a nil model.

Both are still compared field by field — class, name, `inputKeys`, `outputKeys` and the whole `attributes`
dictionary — which is 478 of the 478 comparisons. The 237 rendered on top of that are the arithmetic.

So:

    + (CIFilter *)sepiaToneFilter  { return [CIFilter filterWithName:@"CISepiaTone"]; }

The filter name is not spelled here from a rule. It was read out of the host's own answers, one selector at a
time, by `tests/backports/host/ciimagefilter`'s enumeration of `CIFilter`'s metaclass at run time, and it is
not always the obvious one: `+colorMatrixFilter` answers `CIColorMatrix` and not `CIColorMatrixFilter`, and
`+CMYKHalftone` and `+KMeansFilter` carry no `Filter` at all.

The filter's own arithmetic is the release's, not the port's: `+filterWithName:` is exported from iOS 3.0
(`tools/cache-index/first-rung.py 'filterWithName:'` → 3.0), and it answers nil for a name the running system
has no filter of, which is what Apple documents for a filter that does not exist
(`facts/CoreImage/ImageApplyingFilter.md`). So a constructor for a filter the release does not carry answers
nil, on this port and on a real iOS 16, in the same way.

## Why seven objects and not one

An object carries the API of one release, so the objects are cut by the release each selector itself first
appears at, measured over the 50 held rungs with `tools/cache-index/first-rung.py`:

| object | selectors | the release that exports them |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CIFilterBuiltins7.m` | 1 | iOS 7.0 |
| `CIFilterBuiltins80.m` | 2 | iOS 8.0 |
| `CIFilterBuiltins841.m` | 1 | iOS 8.4.1 |
| `CIFilterBuiltins11.m` | 1 | iOS 11.0 |
| `CIFilterBuiltins16.m` | 220 | iOS 16.0 |
| `CIFilterBuiltins18.m` | 8 | iOS 18.0 |
| `CIFilterBuiltins26.m` | 6 | no held rung: the ladder ends at 10.3.4, so their SDK availability places them at iOS 26.0 |

`CIFilter` itself is the release's own class from iOS 5.0 (`first-rung.py _OBJC_CLASS_$_CIFilter` → 5.0), so
these are a category on it and not a second definition of it. `charon_collect` installs a category method only
where the class does not answer the selector, so a band at or above the release in the table gets the
release's own constructor and a band below it gets this one; the band needs no `maximum` in the registry for
that, and none is written.

## A caveat on the numbers, and it is not a small one

`release-split.lua` and `check_releases` cannot see any of this: a category's method implementations compile
to no exported symbol, so `nm -gU` on these seven objects reports nothing and both checks read them as empty.
The table above is therefore not what relcheck measured — relcheck measured nothing here — it is
`first-rung.py` over the selectors, and the split by hand is what makes each object single-release *true*
rather than merely unchecked.

The six in the last row are placed by their SDK availability and by nothing else. The SDK of 26.2 writes
`+ (CIFilter<CISystemToneMap*> *) systemToneMapFilter NS_AVAILABLE(16_0, 19_0)` while the corpus records the
row at iOS 26.0; no held rung carries the selector either way, so nothing measurable separates 19.0 from
26.0, and the corpus's number is the one the registry takes.

## The check that the harness can fail

The harness's list of methods is read from the runtime, it asserts that the port's objects carry 239
prefixed constructors, and the only way it can report a difference is by finding one. Two of its three
conditions are mechanical: the class, the name and the key sets; the attribute dictionary, key by key and
value by value; and the rendered bytes.

## What is not here

`CIFilterBuiltins.h` also declares a protocol per filter (`@protocol CISepiaTone <CIFilter>`, 192 of them) and
the input properties of each. Those are not rows of the ledger for this band and are not carried: an
application that adopts a filter protocol names properties on a `CIFilter`, which the release's own
key-value coding already answers for any key the filter declares (`facts/CoreImage/ImageApplyingFilter.md`).
