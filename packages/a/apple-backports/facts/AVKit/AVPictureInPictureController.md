# AVPictureInPictureController, iOS 9.0

Rank 18 of `coordination/corpus/crash-demand-top.tsv`, `LOAD-FAIL`, `class_confirmed` against both
`telegram` and `yattee`'s own trees. Five of telegram's own submodules confirm this is real
picture-in-picture used in calls, not merely an availability check the corpus can't otherwise
distinguish from a stub.

## What was checked before writing code

`apple.objc.inventory()` against the armv7 shared cache of 6.1.3 found neither
`AVPictureInPictureController` nor `AVPictureInPictureControllerDelegate` under any name - a
genuine gap. `AVPlayerLayer`, the real class `-initWithPlayerLayer:` takes, is already real and
exported on this release. Ladder-walked to 9.0, matching the SDK header's own attribute this time
(not every class drifts the way `MPRemoteCommandCenter`'s did). A `grep` of this tree's own `.m`
files found no orphaned implementation.

## The wall, measured, not assumed

`AVKit.framework` does not exist at all on this release - not a framework carrying older API
around one missing class, the way `MediaPlayer.framework` does. More fundamentally, no cross-app
window-compositing surface exists anywhere in this tree for a third-party dylib to draw into: the
real system feature floats a window SpringBoard itself owns and composites above every running
app. This is the same wall `CoreSpotlightBackports`' own search bundle hit trying to reach the
system search UI (`-appendResults:` blocks on connection state an out-of-process bundle cannot
reach) - a genuine, measured stop, not a guess. `CallKitBackports`' `CharonCallScreen` answers the
same kind of wall for its own call screen by shipping only the application's half of a two-process
design (Darwin notifications plus a shared file) and naming the other half - a SpringBoard-side
tweak - as something this tree does not currently build. No such companion exists for
picture-in-picture either.

So: this port cannot make the video survive the host app losing focus. That is out of reach
without a SpringBoard-side component, and is not attempted here.

## What is real and in reach

Everything picture-in-picture does *while the host app stays in the foreground* - which is what a
call screen actually needs, and precisely what telegram's five confirming submodules use it for.
`-startPictureInPicture` reparents the caller's real `AVPlayerLayer` - the same `CALayer`, still
attached to the same `AVPlayer`, still decoding and rendering real frames - into a small
(160x90pt) floating `UIWindow` at `UIWindowLevelAlert - 1` (above the host app's own content,
below system alerts), draggable anywhere on screen via a real `UIPanGestureRecognizer` clamped to
the screen bounds, with a double-tap to close. `-stopPictureInPicture` reparents the same layer
back into its original superlayer, at its original frame and sublayer index, and dismisses the
window - the original layout is restored exactly, not approximated.

The real will/did-start and will/did-stop delegate callbacks fire around both transitions, and
`-startPictureInPicture` fires the real `failedToStartPictureInPictureWithError:` callback instead
if the player layer has no superlayer to reparent from or is not yet ready for display -
`AVKitErrorDomain` is referenced as a literal string, not the real exported constant (which this
release does not carry and this port does not otherwise need).

`+isPictureInPictureSupported` answers unconditionally `YES`: unlike the system feature this
substitutes for, an in-app floating window needs no hardware entitlement or background-video
capability - it works identically on every device this release runs on.

## What differs from the release, honestly

- Picture-in-picture does not outlive the host app leaving the foreground - see "the wall,
  measured, not assumed" above. A caller backgrounding the app while picture-in-picture is active
  will simply have its window suspended with the rest of the app, the same as any other UI.
- `-pictureInPicturePossible` is computed fresh from the real `AVPlayerLayer.readyForDisplay` and
  `.player` on every access - real state, not a fixed default - but it is **not** KVO-observable
  the way Apple's own property is documented to be: nothing in this port drives an automatic KVO
  notification when `readyForDisplay` changes underneath it. A caller that reads the property
  directly gets the true answer every time; a caller that key-value-observes it for automatic UI
  updates (e.g. enabling a PiP button) will not see one fire.

## What is not proven

Not measured on device this pass - the floating window, the drag gesture, and the layer
reparenting are host-syntax-checked and gate-verified only. A device pass would confirm: that
reparenting a live `AVPlayerLayer` between an app's own view hierarchy and a separate `UIWindow`
does not glitch or drop frames during the `CATransaction`-wrapped move; that
`UIWindowLevelAlert - 1` in fact keeps the floating window above the host app's content without
also covering system alerts it should not (both expected from the documented window-level
ordering, but not exercised); and that a real call screen's `AVPlayerLayer` (video already
decoding live camera/remote frames) reparents cleanly under real memory and thermal pressure, not
just a static test asset.

## Properties the header declares beside these

Until 2026-09-23 clang synthesized, without a word, an accessor for every property of the header the
class did not write itself (`nm` of the object: `contentSource`, `canStartPictureInPictureAutomaticallyFromInline`,
`canStopPictureInPicture`, `requiresLinearPlayback`, `isPictureInPictureSuspended`), so the class
answered them by storing a value it never used. Now:

- `requiresLinearPlayback` (14.0) is stored and answered: the floating window has no seek control,
  so playback in it is linear whatever the value.
- `pictureInPictureSuspended` answers `NO`: the window is never suspended while the application runs.
- `contentSource` and `-initWithContentSource:` (15.0) and
  `canStartPictureInPictureAutomaticallyFromInline` (14.2) are `@dynamic` and not answered - the
  first two need `AVPictureInPictureControllerContentSource`, which is not carried, the third starts
  picture in picture as the application leaves the foreground, which the window does not survive.
- `canStopPictureInPicture` is tvOS's and is not answered on iOS.
