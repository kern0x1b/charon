# Interactive transitions, iOS 7

A transitioning delegate answers `-interactionControllerForPresentation:` and `-interactionControllerForDismissal:`, and a navigation
controller's delegate `-navigationController:interactionControllerForAnimationController:`, with an object that adopts
`UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning`; when one is answered the transition is driven by the application (a pan gesture, usually):
`UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` moves the animator's animation to a fraction with `-updateInteractiveTransition:` and then
`-finishInteractiveTransition` or `-cancelInteractiveTransition`. iOS 6 has none of it.

Source: the host's own UIKit under Mac Catalyst, recorded by `tests/backports/host/customtransition/run.sh` for an interactive dismissal and an
interactive pop, each finished and each cancelled after `-updateInteractiveTransition:0.4`, and held against the port by
`tests/backports/device/customtransition.m` on the iPad 2 (20 of its 36 records are the interactive ones);
`tests/backports/device/interactivepan.m`, in which a pan gesture driven by real touches (HID digitizer events) pulls a
presented controller down, lets go at 30% (cancelled) and at 70% (finished).

## What the port does

When the interaction controller is answered (and it does not answer NO to `wantsInteractiveStart`) the port does not do the release's
operation at the start, as it does for an animated transition that nobody drives: it leaves the controllers where they are, puts the
from view into the container, sends `viewWillDisappear:` to the from controller and `viewWillAppear:` to the to controller, and
gives the interaction controller the context (`isInteractive` YES). Only when the transition finishes does it do the release's
operation without animation, so the views a gesture is on are not taken out from under it. A cancelled transition changes
nothing of the release's state.

`UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` starts the animator itself (`-startInteractiveTransition:` is what calls `animateTransition:`),
pauses the container's layer (`speed` 0) and moves its `timeOffset`, which is what moves every animation of the animator by a fraction
of `duration` (the animator's `transitionDuration:`). `-finishInteractiveTransition` lets the layer run on from where it is at
`completionSpeed`, so the animator's own completion handler is called, and the transition is completed as the animator says.
`-cancelInteractiveTransition` runs the layer back to zero over the fraction times the duration divided by `completionSpeed`, copies what the
presentation layers show into the model layers, removes the animations (their completion handlers are called with `finished` NO) and
completes the transition with `transitionWasCancelled` YES. `percentComplete`, `duration`, `completionSpeed`, `completionCurve` and
`wantsInteractiveStart` are kept as the system keeps them; `timingCurve` is kept and not used (`inert`, see the registry).

On a cancel the controllers are told as the host tells them: `viewWillDisappear:` and `viewDidDisappear:` of the to controller, then `viewWillAppear:`
and `viewDidAppear:` of the from controller, then the completion handler of a presentation or a dismissal and `-animationEnded:` with NO.
The transition coordinator (see `TransitionCoordinator.md`) is interactive while the interaction runs, is told through
`-notifyWhenInteractionEndsUsingBlock:` and `-notifyWhenInteractionChangesUsingBlock:` when it ends, and answers `isCancelled` for a cancelled one.

## Where it differs from the system

- The interaction controller is kept by the transition until it ends, as the system keeps it, so the application need not.
- The finish and the cancel run in linear time; the system's `completionCurve` shapes them, which the port does not apply.
- Cancelling shows the animator's animation run backwards from a paused layer; an animator that animates something other than the layer properties of views (a
  label's text, for one) is not put back by it.
- A transition that has been finished is completed a moment after the animator completes, so `animationEnded:` comes after it.
