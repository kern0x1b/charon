# The user notification settings, actions and categories, iOS 8

Source: the host's own UIKit, under Mac Catalyst, held against the backport by
`tests/backports/host/uikit2/notifications_test.m` (the system's classes and the backport's, built the same way and
compared, descriptions and archives included); and iOS 6.0 and 6.1.3 on the emulator, an iPhone 4S and an iPad 2,
through `tests/backports/device/uikit2.m`. What the application does with them is in
`UIApplicationNotificationRegistration.md`.

## An action

`UIUserNotificationAction` is a value: an identifier, a title, an activation mode, whether authentication is required
and whether it is destructive. A new mutable action has no identifier and no title, activates in the foreground
(mode 0, background is 1) and is neither authenticated nor destructive. The class adopts `NSCopying`,
`NSMutableCopying` and `NSSecureCoding`: `-copy` answers an immutable `UIUserNotificationAction`, a different object,
that does not equal the original; `-mutableCopy` answers a `UIMutableUserNotificationAction`; changing a mutable copy leaves the
action it was made from as it was. Nil is accepted for the identifier and the title.

## A category

`UIUserNotificationCategory` is an identifier and, for each of two contexts, the list of actions to offer: default is 0
and minimal is 1. A new one has no identifier and no actions - nil, not an empty array - in either context. The mutable one
takes `-setActions:forContext:` and keeps exactly the actions it is given, the objects themselves, in order, with no
limit on their number in either context (five are kept in both); nil takes the list away again.

`-copy` answers an immutable `UIUserNotificationCategory` equal to the original. A category is equal to another only
when the identifier and the actions of both contexts agree: a category with the same identifier and no actions is not equal to one
with actions, and two new empty categories are not equal to each other. The class adopts `NSSecureCoding`, and
an archive of a category holds the same keys as the newest release's, less the two it adds for behaviour and parameters,
which an action of iOS 8 has not; the category decoded from it has the same identifier and the same number of actions.

## Settings

`+settingsForTypes:categories:` keeps the types exactly as given - a value with every bit set is answered with every bit
set - and keeps the categories as a set of immutable copies: a mutable category given comes back as a
`UIUserNotificationCategory`. Nil categories are an empty set, and settings with nil categories equal settings with an empty set
for the same types; settings are equal when the types and the categories are equal, and differ for different types. A
new settings object has types 0 and no categories. The bits are alert 4, badge 1 and sound 2. Settings adopt
`NSSecureCoding`.

## What the description says

The classes describe themselves as the newest release does, in the form
`<UIUserNotificationSettings: address; types: (UIUserNotificationTypeAlert ...);categories: {(...)};>`, with an action
described by its identifier, title, activation mode, authentication and destructive flags; the two fields for
behaviour and parameters that the newest release adds are not part of it, since iOS 8 had neither.

## What iOS 6 does with them

Nothing is shown: iOS 6 has no notification actions, so a category is data the application keeps and the port never
offers, and the settings an application registers reach the release only as the types of its remote notifications.
