# The items, groups and sections of a compositional layout, iOS 13.0

Introduced in iOS 13.0: what a layout is made of. `NSCollectionLayoutItem` is a cell's size, insets and spacing;
`NSCollectionLayoutGroup` is an item that holds items and lays them out in a row (horizontal), a column (vertical) or as it
is told (custom); `NSCollectionLayoutSupplementaryItem` is a view tied to an item or a group by an anchor;
`NSCollectionLayoutBoundarySupplementaryItem` is one that sits at the edge of a section or of the layout;
`NSCollectionLayoutDecorationItem` is a background view; `NSCollectionLayoutSection` is a group, repeated, with the space
around it. The classes are carried so that an application which builds them links and runs; the layout that reads them is
described in `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout.md`.

Source: the host's own UIKit under Mac Catalyst (macOS 27.0), asked each question below and held against the backport by
`tests/backports/host/uikit2` (the `layoutvalues` group), and the header of SDK 16.4. The device test is
`tests/backports/device/compositional.m`.

## What the port does as UIKit does

- Defaults. An item made with `itemWithLayoutSize:` has zero content insets, an edge spacing of four fixed zeros, no
  supplementary items (an empty array) and an identifier; a decoration item has a whole-container size, no edge spacing and
  z index 0; a supplementary item has z index 1, no item anchor; a boundary item extends the boundary, is not pinned, and has
  no container anchor; a group has an inter-item spacing of fixed zero; a section has zero insets and spacing, no
  orthogonal scrolling, empty boundary and decoration arrays and follows the content insets. `new` and `init` give an empty
  object - a nil size, no identifier, a section that does not follow the insets - exactly as the host's do, though the
  headers mark them unavailable.
- `-description`. An item prints `<NSCollectionLayoutItem 0x...; name=(null); size={...};` then, one to a line and indented
  by a tab, `edgeSpacing=...;`, `identfier=...;` (the spelling is UIKit's) and `contentInsets={t,l,b,r}>`. A group adds
  `group: subitems=`, its subitems each indented one tab deeper than the group, and `interItemSpacing=...;`,
  `layoutDirection=.horizontal>` (a custom group says `.vertical`). A section prints `<NSCollectionLayoutSection: 0x...;
  group = <NSCollectionLayoutGroup: 0x...>` and, only for what differs from the default, `contentInsets`,
  `supplementariesFollowContentInsets = NO`, `interGroupSpacing`, `orthogonalScrollingBehavior` by name (Continuous,
  Continuous Group Leading Boundary, Paging, Group Paging, Group Paging Centered, `(unknown value: n)`),
  `boundarySupplementaryItems = <0x...>` and `decorationItems = <0x...>`.
- Copies. Every one copies to a new object. An item copies its size and edge spacing and shares its supplementary items; a
  group copies its subitems, and its spacing; a section copies its group and its decoration items and shares its boundary
  items; a group made from subitems keeps copies of them. A group made for a repeating count is one subitem, a copy of the
  item with its width (horizontal) or height (vertical) replaced by one over the count.
- Equality is by content: size, insets, edge spacing and supplementary items of an item; the element kind, z index and
  anchors of a supplementary item; alignment, offset, extension and pinning of a boundary item; kind, z index and insets of a
  decoration item; direction, subitems and spacing of a group (the block of a custom group is not compared); every property of
  a section. A class is equal only to its own class.
- Exceptions, all `NSInternalInconsistencyException`: `A size is required.` for a group without a size,
  `At least 1 subitem is required for a group` for a group with none or a custom group without a provider,
  `A repeating horizontal group should specify a count >= 1` (vertical likewise), `Invalid parameter not satisfying: group`
  for a section without a group. A nil item for a repeating group is the array literal's exception. Nothing else is checked;
  the section, and the layout, check the supplementary kinds when they lay out: `Error: Every supplementary must have a unique
  elementKind: duplicates detected: (...)`.
- Setters. `supplementaryItems` of a group and `edgeSpacing` and `contentInsets` of an item are settable; setting nil
  leaves nil. A section's decoration items become an empty array when set to nil, and its boundary items stay nil.

## What the port does not carry

- `-[NSCollectionLayoutGroup visualDescription]`, a drawing of the group in characters on a canvas of 100 columns and 50
  rows, a debugging aid. The port has no such drawing, and `respondsToSelector:` says no.
- `+[NSCollectionLayoutGroup horizontalGroupWithLayoutSize:repeatingSubitem:count:]` and its vertical twin (16.0),
  `supplementaryContentInsetsReference` (16.0) and `orthogonalScrollingProperties` (17.0): they belong to later releases.
- The host answers `-setSupplementaryItems:` on an item too, which the header declares read-only; the port does not.
- `orthogonalScrollingBehavior` and `visibleItemsInvalidationHandler` are acted on: see Orthogonal scrolling in the layout's facts.
- `NSCollectionLayoutVisibleItem` is adopted by an object of the port's own that the handler is given, with the members the header
  has.

## Where the port differs

- `-hash` of equal objects, as for the values.
