# The adjusted content inset of a scroll view, iOS 11.0

Introduced in iOS 11.0: the content inset a scroll view really lays out by,
once the safe area is folded into it.

Source: UIKit of the arm64 shared cache of iOS 11.0
(`-[UIScrollView adjustedContentInset]` at `0x18a2a8320`,
`-_edgesApplyingSafeAreaInsetsToContentInset` at `0x18a2a97f0`,
`-_contentScrollsAlongXAxis` at `0x18a2aa180`), read in full. There is no host
differential for this one either: a scroll view outside a window has no safe
area to fold in, so the expectations of the device test come from the algorithm
below.

## Which edges of the safe area are folded in

`-_edgesApplyingSafeAreaInsetsToContentInset` answers a mask of edges, and the
answer depends on the behaviour and on whether the content scrolls:

| behaviour | edges |
|---|---|
| `Never` | none |
| `Always` | all four |
| `Automatic`, `ScrollableAxes` | see below |

For the two automatic behaviours:

1. the horizontal edges are taken when the content is wider than the frame or
   `-_contentScrollsAlongXAxis` says it scrolls that way; otherwise only the
   top and bottom are kept;
2. the vertical edges are dropped again — in the code literally
   `edges &= Left|Right` — when the content is no taller than the frame and
   `-_contentScrollsAlongYAxis` says it does not scroll that way;
3. finally, when the behaviour is `Automatic` **and** UIKit has marked the
   scroll view as the content scroll view of a controller
   (`-_applyVerticalSafeAreaInsetsToNonscrollingContent`), the top and bottom
   are added back.

`-_contentScrollsAlongXAxis` reads a three-valued flag: set by UIKit, or, when
unset, decided from the content size against the frame.

`adjustedContentInset` is then the content inset plus the safe area on the
edges that survived, edge by edge.

## The one part that does not reach iOS 6

Step 3 rests on a mark UIKit puts on the controller's content scroll view.
iOS 6 has no such mark and no such notion, so for the port that flag is always
off: `Automatic` and `ScrollableAxes` behave the same way. Everything else
carries over exactly, including that bouncing counts as scrolling, which is how
the port reads `-_contentScrollsAlong*Axis` without the flag: the content is
larger than the frame on that axis, or the scroll view always bounces on it.

Like the safe area itself, Apple keeps the adjusted inset in a field (offset
`0x5d0`) and refreshes it during layout; the port computes it on every read,
for the same reason and with the same result.

`-adjustedContentInsetDidChange` and `-[UIScrollViewDelegate scrollViewDidChangeAdjustedContentInset:]`
are not declared: both are called from the moment the value changes, which the
port never sees without replacing UIKit's layout.
