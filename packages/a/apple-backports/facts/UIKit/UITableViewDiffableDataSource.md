# UITableViewDiffableDataSource, iOS 13.0

Introduced in iOS 13.0: the data source of `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource.md`, for a table view. It has the same `snapshot`, index path and
identifier lookups, `-applySnapshot:animatingDifferences:` and `-applySnapshot:animatingDifferences:completion:`, and `defaultRowAnimation`.
The 14.0 members are the collection view's alone.

Source and method: as for the collection view, in the `diffabledatasource` group of `tests/backports/host/uikit2` (a third of the trials are
table views) and in `device/diffable.m`.

## What the port does as the system does

- The rows are moved, inserted, deleted and reloaded with `defaultRowAnimation`, which starts as `UITableViewRowAnimationAutomatic`, and
  without animation when `animatingDifferences` is NO.
- A table view cannot move a row out of a section that is deleted or into one that is inserted, so an apply that would has the table `reloadData`,
  and the provider is asked for every row; so it does when more than one section moves.
- The callbacks are `numberOfSectionsInTableView:`, `tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:` (past the end: "Invalid parameter not satisfying: section <
  _impl.numberOfSections"; nil index path: "indexPath") and `tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:`, which raises "Invalid parameter not
  satisfying: itemIdentifier" for a path with no item and "UITableViewDiffableDataSource cell provider returned nil for index path ... with item
  identifier '...', which is not allowed. You must always return a cell to the table view: ..." for a cell not returned. It answers no header, footer,
  editing, moving or index title callback: a subclass that wants one adds it, and `respondsToSelector:` is the system's.

## Where the port departs

- The same rule as the collection view's: a batch whose counts the port cannot prove, any move of a row between sections, and a section change
  mixed with row changes are a `reloadData`, so the animation is lost and the provider is asked for every row.

- The rule for when the system falls back to `reloadData` for a table is read from its answers: a row that moves out of a deleted section
  or into an inserted one, or more than one section that moves. In a few batches with several section moves the system does not fall back
  where the port does, and the provider is asked for other cells; the counts and index paths are the same.
- What the table view of iOS 6 accepts inside `beginUpdates` - a section moved with rows inserted into it, a row moved between sections - was not
  read from the release; `device/diffable.m` runs forty random snapshots through a table view and a collection view of the device to say.

## `applySnapshotUsingReloadData:`, `sectionIdentifierForIndex:` and `indexForSectionIdentifier:`, iOS 15.0

`UIKit/UIDiffableDataSource+iOS15.m`, over the data source's own state.

- `-applySnapshotUsingReloadData:` and its completion form take the snapshot as current, without its reload marks, call `reloadData` and
  `layoutIfNeeded` on the table and run the completion on the main queue afterwards - what an `applySnapshot:` that cannot diff already
  does, now on request. No difference is worked out and nothing is animated, as the header asks. A nil snapshot raises
  "Invalid parameter not satisfying: snapshot", the port's wording for `applySnapshot:`. The next `applySnapshot:` diffs against this
  snapshot, as against any applied one.
- `-sectionIdentifierForIndex:` answers the section at that index of the current snapshot, and nil for a negative or out-of-range index -
  nil because the header declares the result nullable, not because the system's answer was read.
- `-indexForSectionIdentifier:` answers the snapshot's `indexOfSectionIdentifier:`, NSNotFound for a section that is not there.

None of this was held against the system: no host oracle runs on this machine (Catalyst is not installed) and no device run was made.
Ladder by `objc.inventory` (`.agent-work/plan-and-analysis/b1314-flips/ladder-diffable.log`, with `applySnapshot:animatingDifferences:`
as the positive control and an invented selector as the negative one): the class is in neither the 6.1.3 nor the 12.0 cache, and all four
methods are in 16.0 and 18.0. There is no 13-15 cache, so `introduced` stays the header's 15.0.
