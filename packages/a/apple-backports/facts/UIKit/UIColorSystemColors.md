# The system colours of iOS 7 and iOS 9

Source: the UIKitCore of iOS 12.0 arm64 (`dyld_shared_cache_arm64`), read for the components themselves,
and the other frameworks of the same release that draw with them.

The nine colours are opaque and fixed - this is before the release made them depend on an appearance -
and each is a triple of bytes over 255:

| colour | red | green | blue |
|---|---|---|---|
| `systemRedColor` | 255 | 59 | 48 |
| `systemGreenColor` | 76 | 217 | 100 |
| `systemBlueColor` | 0 | 122 | 255 |
| `systemOrangeColor` | 255 | 149 | 0 |
| `systemYellowColor` | 255 | 204 | 0 |
| `systemPinkColor` | 255 | 45 | 85 |
| `systemTealColor` | 90 | 200 | 250 |
| `systemGrayColor` | 142 | 142 | 147 |
| `systemPurpleColor` | 88 | 86 | 214 |

Every component of that table that is not 0 or 1 is a `double` literal in UIKitCore of iOS 12.0, in the
constant pools its colour code reads from - `59/255` at `0x1ad730288`, `48/255` at `0x1ad730c58`,
`76/255`, `217/255` and `100/255` at `0x1ad730c60`, `0x1ad72e488` and `0x1ad730c70`, `122/255` at
`0x1ad730c78`, `149/255` at `0x1ad730c80`, `204/255` at `0x1ad72e308`, `45/255` and `85/255` at
`0x1ad730ca0` and `0x1ad72f8d0`, `90/255`, `200/255` and `250/255` at `0x1ad730c88`, `0x1ad730c90` and
`0x1ad730c98`, `142/255` and `147/255` at `0x1ad72ee68` and `0x1ad72ee70`, and `88/255`, `86/255` and
`214/255` at `0x1ad730ca8`, `0x1ad72f8c0` and `0x1ad72f440`.

Nine other frameworks of that release carry the pairs whole, which is how a value can be tied to its
colour rather than only to the pool: `(59, 48)` in StoreKitUI, `(217, 100)` in ChatKit, `(122, 255)` in
VectorKit, `(149, 0)` in HomeUI, `(204, 0)` in Vision, `(45, 85)` in SpringBoardUI, `(200, 250)` in
Weather, `(142, 147)` in PassKitCore and `(86, 214)` in GameCenterUI - each of them a framework that
draws in the system colour of its own kind.

The host is not a source for these: under Mac Catalyst the palette follows the Mac, and
`+systemBlueColor` there answers `(0, 136, 255)`, the machine's accent, not the release's blue.
