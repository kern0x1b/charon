# UIContextMenuInteraction, iOS 13.0 and 14.0

Introduced in iOS 13.0: the interaction a view is given to show a context menu on a long press or a right click, with a preview the view lifts
into, an animator handed to the delegate, and, since 14.0, a menu that can be updated while it is showing.

iOS 6 has none of the machinery: no menu view, no preview morph, no highlight of the source view, no animator for a presentation. The port
chooses the smallest thing that is honest - **the menu appears as an action sheet** - and says so once in the log the first time it is shown.

Source: the host's own UIKit under Mac Catalyst (macOS 27.0), held against the backport by `tests/backports/host/uikit2` (the `menus`
group) for everything that can be asked without showing a menu, and the header of SDK 16.4. The sheet itself cannot be shown in a Mac
Catalyst tool or a bare device tool; it is exercised on an iPhone 4S or an iPad 2 only.

## As UIKit does

- `-initWithDelegate:` keeps the delegate **weakly**; nil is accepted; `-delegate` answers nil once the delegate is gone.
- `view` is nil until the interaction is added to a view (`UIView+Interactions` sends `-willMoveToView:` and `-didMoveToView:`), and nil again
  after it is removed.
- `-locationInView:` answers `(CGFLOAT_MAX, CGFLOAT_MAX)` when no interaction is in progress. While one is in progress the port
  answers the touch that began it, in the coordinates of the view asked about.
- `-dismissMenu` does nothing when no menu shows; `-updateVisibleMenuWithBlock:` does not call the block when none does.

## What the port does

1. Adding the interaction to a view puts a `UILongPressGestureRecognizer` on the view, and removing it takes the recognizer off. The host installs five
   private recognisers (secondary click, press, touch duration and two relationship recognisers); this is the one iOS 6 has an equivalent of.
2. When the long press begins, the interaction asks the delegate for a configuration at the touch. Nil means nothing happens.
3. It calls the configuration's action provider with an empty array and takes the `UIMenu` it returns. No menu, or one whose elements are all disabled or hidden,
   means nothing is shown and no callback is sent.
4. The menu becomes an action sheet:
   - elements that are `Disabled` or `Hidden` are left out; a menu with the `Inline` option contributes its children to the sheet, and any other submenu is
     a button whose title ends in a `›` and which opens a second sheet with its children;
   - the first element that is `Destructive` (or the first menu with the `Destructive` option) is the sheet's red button, which iOS 6 has one of and puts on
     top; the rest are ordinary buttons in the order of the menu;
   - a state of on puts a check mark before the title, mixed an en dash; a title that is empty falls back on the discoverability title, and an element with
     neither is left out; images are not drawn, since a sheet button has none;
   - a deferred element is asked for its elements, and the sheet waits up to 1.5 seconds for the answers;
   - the sheet has a Cancel button, anchored to the touch in a popover on an iPad and from the window's bottom on an iPhone.
5. `-contextMenuInteraction:willDisplayMenuForConfiguration:animator:` is sent before the sheet is shown, and `...willEndForConfiguration:animator:` when it is
   about to leave, with an animator that runs `-addAnimations:` at once and `-addCompletion:` after the sheet has been presented or has gone, and whose
   `previewViewController` is nil. Choosing an action calls its handler once the sheet is gone; Cancel and a tap outside end the interaction, with `willEnd` sent and no handler run.
6. `-updateVisibleMenuWithBlock:` (14.0) calls the block with a copy of the menu on screen and, if it returns a menu, shows the sheet again
   without animation with it; `-dismissMenu` cancels the sheet.

## What is not done, and how the registry records it

- `-contextMenuInteraction:previewForHighlightingMenuWithConfiguration:`, `...previewForDismissingMenuWithConfiguration:` and
  `...willPerformPreviewActionForMenuWithConfiguration:animator:` are **never called** (`absent`: the port sends none of them), and the preview provider of the configuration
  never runs; nothing is lifted, morphed or tapped.
- `UIContextMenuInteractionCommitAnimating` is never handed out.
- `menuAppearance` is **compact** always, where the host answers rich before a menu shows: a rich menu is the one with a preview, and there is none.
- A second touch or a rotation while the sheet shows is left to the sheet; the interaction does not follow the view as the host's menu does.
- One `Destructive` button is red at most; another `Destructive` element is an ordinary button.
