# UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration and the list layout, iOS 14.0

`UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration`, `+[NSCollectionLayoutSection sectionWithListConfiguration:layoutEnvironment:]` and `+[UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout layoutWithListConfiguration:]`.

## What the port does as UIKit does
- The section is a horizontal group of one item, with the host's content insets per appearance (the sidebar's 12.987012987012987 sides), a pinned 28 point header for plain lists and an unpinned 17.5 one for the others, boundary supplementary items, z index 200 and extended boundary. Thirty combinations of appearance, header and footer mode are compared for structure.
- `layoutWithListConfiguration:` draws the row separators of a layout of one configuration.

## Differences
- The row estimate is 44 for every appearance where the host measured 40.04 for plain, because this release has no self sizing cells: a row is 44 high and does not grow to its text.
- The swipe action providers are kept and never asked (`inert`, said once in the log). The background decoration item, the outline expansion animation and the separator handlers of iOS 15 (`separatorConfiguration`, `itemSeparatorHandler`, `headerTopPadding`, all `@dynamic`) are not carried.

## What the host measures that a phone would not

The host is Catalyst, so its metrics are those of the Mac idiom: row margins {15,16,15,8}, a plain row estimate of 40.04 (44 x 0.91), a sidebar inset of 12.987 (10 / 0.77), a corner radius of 26 for grouped and sidebar lists, some Mac colours. The port follows the host's raw values, except the row estimate of a list layout, which is 44, the phone's. Nothing here was measured on an iPhone; `Dynamic Light Alpha` was 0.12 in light and 0.4 in dark, and the port carries 0.12, since this release has no dark mode.

Source: the host's own UIKit under Mac Catalyst (macOS 27.0), measured with random values and states side by side with the port in one process, and the header of SDK 16.4. The differential tests are `tests/backports/host/uikit2` (the `listvalues` group for values, the windowed `listcell` group for views); the device application is `tests/backports/device/lists.m`, held to the numbers the host recorded in `lists-expectations.h`.
