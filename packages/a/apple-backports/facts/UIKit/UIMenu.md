# UIMenu, iOS 13.0 and 14.0

Introduced in iOS 13.0: a titled group of menu elements, which nests. `+menuWithChildren:`
(14.0) makes one with nothing but its children. The port keeps the value and shows it only through
`UIContextMenuInteraction` (see its facts), as a sheet of buttons.

Source: the host's own UIKit under Mac Catalyst (macOS 27.0), held against the backport by
`tests/backports/host/uikit2` (the `menus` group).

## As UIKit does

- `+menuWithTitle:image:identifier:options:children:` copies the title and the children array, keeps the image and
  the options, and makes the identifier `com.apple.menu.dynamic.` and a UUID when it is given none. `+menuWithTitle:children:`
  and `+menuWithChildren:` (title empty, not nil) are the same with the defaults. A nil title stays nil, and nil children
  are an empty array.
- A child that is not a `UIMenuElement` raises `NSInvalidArgumentException` - the host's message names a private
  selector, the port's names the same one - from every entry point that takes children.
- `-menuByReplacingChildren:` is a menu with the same title, image, identifier and options and the given children, kept as they
  are, not copied; nil keeps the children the menu has.
- `-copy` copies every child, so a copy's children are other objects that are equal to the originals.
- Two menus are equal when their identifiers are; a menu never equals an action with the same identifier.
- `-description` is `<UIMenu: 0x...; title = M; identifier = com.m; image = <UIImage: 0x...>; options = (Inline|Destructive); children = <NSArray: 0x...>>`,
  the title when not empty, the identifier always, the image and the options when set, the children always. The options are named `Inline`,
  `Destructive` and `SingleSelection`.
- Archiving writes `title`, `identifier`, `options`, `children` and `image`, plus the element size keys the host's unarchiver reads.

## Where the port differs

- A menu the host has decoded prints `currentSelection = <NSArray>` after the options; the port never does.
- `preferredElementSize` and `selectedElements` (15.0 and 16.0) are not carried.
