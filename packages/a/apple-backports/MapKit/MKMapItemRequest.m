// MKMapItemRequest: one place, asked for by the map's own feature, answered or refused honestly.
//
// The shape of the wall is measured and it is narrow. The request is made FOR A MAP FEATURE -- the
// 16.4 header's designated initialiser is -initWithMapFeatureAnnotation: and the only other way in is
// +new, which the header marks unavailable -- and a `MKMapFeatureAnnotation` is one of the map's own
// features: a thing the map itself knows about, which arrives with a map that has features. This
// release's map has none, and `MKMapFeatureAnnotation` is registered `absent` with that reason, so
// there is nothing here for a request to resolve.
//
// What is therefore real and what is not, and the split is the same everywhere in this library:
//
//   -cancel, -cancelled, -loading          real: a running request that was asked to stop
//   -featureAnnotation, -mapFeatureAnnotation  the feature the request was made for, which is nil,
//                                          and nil is the honest answer where there is no map feature
//   -getMapItemWithCompletionHandler:       answers with the header's own error, in MKErrorDomain,
//                                          saying the map has no features to resolve -- and NOT with a
//                                          made-up place
//
// A release whose map does have features -- Apple's own -- resolves this properly, and nothing here
// stands in its way: the request holds the feature it was given, reports its own state, and hands the
// resolution to whatever asked for it.

#import <objc/message.h>

// The feature the request was made for, declared because the 16.4 header's own class is registered
// absent in this library and the compiler needs to see the type.
