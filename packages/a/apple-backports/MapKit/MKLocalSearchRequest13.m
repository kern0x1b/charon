// The request objects the search and the routing are asked with, as categories on the release's own
// classes and as the one new class the map's own points of interest need.
//
// The release HAS MKLocalSearchRequest, MKDirectionsRequest, MKLocalSearch and
// MKLocalSearchCompleter (apple.objc.inventory on the armv7 cache of 6.1.3: the request carries
// -naturalLanguageQuery and -region and their setters, the search carries -initWithRequest:,
// -startWithCompletionHandler:, -cancel and -isSearching), so what iOS 7 and later added to them is a
// CATEGORY on a class the release carries, and the gate's own check names each member because a
// caller's member is reached through the category -- the same rule the CPListItem rows needed.
//
// What is implemented and what is the wall, and the wall is one class:
//
//   -naturalLanguageQuery:region:, -initWithNaturalLanguageQuery:region:, -initWithCompletion:,
//   -resultTypes, -pointOfInterestFilter, -addressFilter, -regionPriority
//       the release's own search, and its own two properties, doing the work: the query and the
//       region are the release's, the result types and the filters narrow what the release's search
//       is asked for, and the completion and the initialisers are the header's own shapes.
//
//   -transportType, -requestsAlternateRoutes, -departureDate, -arrivalDate, -tollPreference,
//   -highwayPreference
//       the release's own MKDirections request, extended with the members the routing this port
//       already does reads: MKDirections7.m asks for the transport type and the departure date, and
//       an alternate-routes request is what its own `alternatives=true` is.
//
//   -initWithPointsOfInterestRequest:                the release's own search, over the wall below.
//
//   -completerDidUpdateResults: and -completer:didFailWithError:
//       the completer delegate, which the port's own MKLocalSearchCompleter already sends both of
//       (MKLocalSearchCompleter.m calls the update message and the failure one through the runtime).
//
//   MKLocalPointsOfInterestRequest, and its four members
//       **absent**, and that is the one wall in this file: the points of interest are a MAP'S OWN --
//       the restaurants and stations a map knows about, which arrive with a map that has them. This
//       release's map has none, so there is no centre and radius to search around, and the class is
//       registered absent with that reason rather than built as a request for nothing.
