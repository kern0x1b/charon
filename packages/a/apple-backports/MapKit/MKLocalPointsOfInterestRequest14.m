// MKLocalPointsOfInterestRequest, iOS 14's own object and the object of that release alone: a search
// of the MAP'S OWN points of interest over a circle or a region, narrowed to the categories a filter
// names. Its two initialisers, its three read-only members and its filter are all here, and nothing
// else of release 14 is in this file.
//
// MEASURED FIRST, and it decides what this file can be. The class is not the release's:
//
//     CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l tools/corpus/cache-census.lua MKLocalPointsOfInterest 6.1.3 4.3 16.0
//     6.1.3  images 524,  classes 11378,  of which MKLocalPointsOfInterest* 0
//     4.3    images 354,  classes 7187,   of which MKLocalPointsOfInterest* 0
//     16.0   images 2664, classes 143137, of which MKLocalPointsOfInterest* 1 (MKLocalPointsOfInterestRequest)
//     control: 1 name(s) beginning MKLocalPointsOfInterest found in this run, so a zero on another
//     rung is the release's and not the reader's
//
// and neither release has the class's own entry points either: grep -cxF on each release's selector
// table (~/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/selectors_armv7.txt and .../4.3/selectors_armv7.txt) answers 0 for
// initWithCenterCoordinate:radius:, 0 for initWithCoordinateRegion: and 0 for pointOfInterestCategory.
// So this is the port's own class, defined under Apple's own name, and the 16.0 rung is the control
// that says the reader finds the name when the release has it.
//
// WHAT THE RELEASE DOES HAVE, measured on the armv7 cache of 6.1.3 with apple.objc.inventory, and
// this is the correction of what this library used to claim here. The rows of this class used to say
// "a MAP'S OWN points of interest ... arrive with a map that has them. This release's map has none",
// and that is false. The release's own MKLocalSearchRequest carries -naturalLanguageQuery and
// -region with their setters, its own MKLocalSearch carries -initWithRequest: and
// -startWithCompletionHandler:, its own MKLocalSearchResponse carries -mapItems, and its own
// MKMapItem carries -name, -placemark, -isBusiness, -rating, -numberOfRatings, -numberOfReviews and
// -attributions. Those last four are the fields of a BUSINESS, which is what a point of interest is
// on a release whose map knows places: this release's own search answers a question about points of
// interest. What the release has no member for is the request that describes one, so the request is
// carried here and the search stays the release's.
//
// THE HONEST LIMIT, and it is why every row of this class is `inert` and not `implemented`: nothing
// in this library applies the request yet. The one caller a program has is
// -[MKLocalSearch initWithPointsOfInterestRequest:], whose row is not this object's and whose
// implementation makes the release's own search with an EMPTY request and drops its argument
// (MKLocalSearchRequest13.m, and the registry row for it says so in its own words). So the symbols
// here load and answer exactly what the caller gave them, and the release's own search is still
// asked with no query. That is what `inert` means, and it is the whole of the effect until the
// search reads a request. Where a caller hands the request something -- the three initialisers and
// the filter -- the object says so ONCE in the log, which is what the registry README asks of an
// inert entry, so a program that reaches it leaves a line instead of quietly getting a search with
// no query. The four members that only read back what was set do not say anything: they answer the
// caller exactly.
//
// AND WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: the header also declares MKPointsOfInterestRequestMaxRadius, which Apple's
// own framework holds as 2000 metres and which this library already carries (MKPointOfInterestCategories16.m,
// measured out of the host's own MapKit). A request is NOT clamped to it here. What a release's own
// search does with a radius above its own maximum is that release's answer and not this port's to
// invent, so the object records the radius the caller gave and the search -- the release's own -- is
// the one that decides.
//
// WHAT IS REAL INSTEAD OF HELD FOR ITS OWN SAKE: the circle and the region answer each other through
// the RELEASE'S OWN PROJECTION, not through a constant of this port's -- MKMapPointForCoordinate,
// MKMapPointsPerMeterAtLatitude and MKCoordinateRegionForMapRect are all in the armv7 cache of 3.2
// and later. A request made of a circle answers a region that encloses it, and a request made of a
// region answers the circle that covers it, so the two initialisers agree on the same place -- and
// they agree with the HOST'S OWN class of this name to the last printed digit, which is what
// tests/backports/host/mapkit-poi-request measures and what its mutant shows can see a wrong value.

// MKCoordinateRegionForMapRect.

// The circle that COVERS a region: the larger of the region's two half-spans, in the release's own

// the host's own class of the same name (tests/backports/host/mapkit-poi-request, whose transcripts
// are compared value for value):
//
//   - MapKit's y grows SOUTHWARDS, so the half-height is the southern edge's y LESS the northern
//     edge's y. Taking that difference the other way round gives a negative height, and a radius read
//     off it is 0 -- which is what an earlier version of this file answered for every region.
//   - the reading is the LARGER half-span and not the diagonal, because a circle and a region are two
//     spellings of one place and the round trip has to be exact: a request made of a circle of 500 m
//     answers a region whose half-spans are both 500 m, and that region answers 500 m back. The
//     host's own class round trips exactly too (measured: 500.000 m in, 500.000 m out), and for a
//     region of uneven sides it answers the larger half-span as well.
