// The few pieces of MapKit's arithmetic the release's own C API does not export, in one place, so
// the objects that use them agree with each other to the last bit.
//
// What the release does export is used directly wherever it has it: MKMapPointForCoordinate,
// MKCoordinateForMapPoint, MKMetersPerMapPointAtLatitude, MKMapPointsPerMeterAtLatitude,
// MKCoordinateRegionForMapRect, MKMapRectUnion, MKMapRectIntersection, MKMapSizeWorld and
// MKMapRectWorld are all in the armv7 dyld shared cache of 3.2 and later, so the projection this
// port draws with is the release's own projection and not a copy of it. What is left here is the
// map size of a zoom scale, the map rect of a coordinate region, and the bearing between two
// coordinates, none of which MapKit.framework exports on this release.
//
// Everything here is Charon's own and carries no API: the members are prefixed charon_ because
// apple/backports.lua's added_members() reads any other Objective-C member as an API the package
// carries, and the build's registry check then wants an entry for it.
// Included once: the port's own declarations are reached from every object of this library and
// from the host probes, which include this header beside the SDK's own MapKit.framework.
