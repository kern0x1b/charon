// The two decode variants of SDK 18.0, and what each one does now that the host has been measured with a
// real H264 sample.
//
// THE OPTIONS ARE IGNORED, and that is the host's answer rather than this port's preference. Measured on this
// Mac, 2026-10-03, on a real 221-byte avc1 sample at 64x48 with five dictionaries - and all five lines are
// IDENTICAL:
//
//   NULL options                 DecodeFrame=0 WithOptions=0 handlerCalls=2 infoFlags=0 ...AndOutputHandler=-12902
//   empty options                DecodeFrame=0 WithOptions=0 handlerCalls=2 infoFlags=0 ...AndOutputHandler=-12902
//   an unknown key               DecodeFrame=0 WithOptions=0 handlerCalls=2 infoFlags=0 ...AndOutputHandler=-12902
//   ContentAnalyzerRotation=90   DecodeFrame=0 WithOptions=0 handlerCalls=2 infoFlags=0 ...AndOutputHandler=-12902
//   ContentAnalyzerCropRectangle DecodeFrame=0 WithOptions=0 handlerCalls=2 infoFlags=0 ...AndOutputHandler=-12902
//
// `handlerCalls` is the session's SINGLE-image callback, and it rises by two per line - one from the control
// `DecodeFrame` and one from the options call - so the decode really happened both times; `infoFlags` was
// handed in as 0x5a5A5A5A and comes back 0, so the callee WROTE it. An unknown key is therefore not refused
// and not honoured: it is dropped. The two `kVTDecodeFrameOptionKey_` names are the only ones in any SDK (both
// 26.0) and this host acts on neither of them either - consistent with no release the port builds having a
// `kVTDecodeFrameOptionKey_` of any kind (4.3=0, 6.1.3=0) - so the release does not implement them, and the
// only honest thing to do with a dictionary of them is what the host does with it.
//
// The earlier reasoning on this family said the opposite - "there is no dictionary to ask, so a caller's
// options cannot be passed anywhere" - and it pointed at the wrong thing: the options CAN be passed and are
// dropped. That sentence is retracted in facts/VideoToolbox/DecodeEncodeVariants.md.
//
// The arity question is settled too, and in the direction that makes this a forward: the 16.4 SDK declares
// `VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame` with five parameters including `infoFlagsOut`
// (VTDecompressionSession.h:184-190, API_AVAILABLE(macosx(10.8), ios(8.0), tvos(10.2))), and on ARM an EXTRA
// argument is harmless while a MISSING one is not, so calling that form at 4.3 is safe. The annotation says
// when the symbol became public, not how many arguments the 4.3 code reads.

// The options are dropped, so the dictionary is not even looked at. Taking it as a parameter and ignoring it
// is the whole of the host's behaviour here; the parameter is still named, because the API has it.
