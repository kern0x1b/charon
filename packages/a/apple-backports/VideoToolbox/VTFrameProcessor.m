#import "CharonVideoToolbox.h"

// VTFrameProcessor: the object an application starts a session on, feeds frames to, and ends.
//
// WHAT IT ANSWERS ON THIS RELEASE, and why, is the whole of this file. It is measured, not assumed:
//
//   - the release's armv7 6.1.3 cache carries no frame processor at all. `objc-inventory.lua` over
//     $HOME/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7 and `dump-cache.lua` over the same file find no
//     VTFrameProcessor class and no VTFrameProcessor* symbol, and VideoToolbox's own header on the
//     armv7 ladder declares none of these nine methods; the seventeen configuration and parameter
//     classes arrived with iOS 26.0 and no release this package covers has one of them.
//
//   - the effects these configurations describe are motion estimation, frame interpolation, super
//     resolution and temporal noise filtering, and SDK 26.2's own header says of the super-resolution
//     scaler that it "may require ML models" and of the pipeline that it is built for hardware the
//     framework finds for itself. There is no armv7 release with a Neural Engine, and there is no
//     release with the framework that would drive one.
//
// So every member here answers exactly what SDK 26.2 documents for a device that does not have the
// hardware, which is what the port's own contract requires of it: `+isSupported` on every
// configuration class is NO, a session refuses to start with VTFrameProcessorInitializationFailed
// ("the session failed to initialize the processing pipeline"), and a frame handed to a processor with
// no session is refused with VTFrameProcessorSessionNotStarted ("the session is used to process frames
// without being started"), which is the code SDK 26.2 defines for that case and not a substitute.
//
// The two things that are NOT the processor's own business are done here rather than faked:
//
//   - a nil configuration or a nil parameter is answered with VTFrameProcessorInvalidParameterError,
//     which is what SDK 26.2 reserves for "one of the provided parameters is not valid", and it is
//     decided BEFORE the hardware question, because a caller that passes nil would get the same
//     answer on a device that has the hardware;
//   - every block-taking method RUNS its block, with the error, exactly once. An error channel that
//     leaves a caller waiting is not the documented behaviour: VTFrameProcessor.h says of
//     processWithParameters:completionHandler: "This completion handler is called when frame
//     processing is completed", and an authorization- or download-shaped completion that never runs is
//     a hang. So the completion is called on the calling thread before the method returns, which is
//     also what "asynchronously performs" means for a call that does no asynchronous work.
//
// `processWithCommandBuffer:parameters:` has no error channel AT ALL - it returns void, it takes no
// NSError, and SDK 26.2 says only "Performs effects in a Metal command buffer". That gap is Apple's,
// not the port's, and it is written up in coordination/crutches.md rather than papered over here: the
// port cannot report through a channel the header does not have, and every armv7 device a caller can
// reach this on answers +isSupported NO first.
