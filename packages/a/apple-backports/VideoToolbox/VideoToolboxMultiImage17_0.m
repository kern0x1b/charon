// The four decode and encode variants of SDK 17.0, and what each one can honestly do on a release that
// exports none of them.
//
// The measurement that decides all four (tools/corpus/dump-cache.lua over
// $HOME/.charon/dyld/4.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7, and v-audio's 6.1.3 armv7 dump, 2026-10-03):
//
//   _VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrameWithMultiImageCapableOutputHandler   4.3=0  6.1.3=0
//   _VTDecompressionSessionSetMultiImageCallback                           4.3=0  6.1.3=0
//   _VTCompressionSessionEncodeMultiImageFrame                             4.3=0  6.1.3=0
//   _VTCompressionSessionEncodeMultiImageFrameWithOutputHandler            4.3=0  6.1.3=0
//   _VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame                                      4.3=1  6.1.3=1

//
// So the single-frame entry points ARE the release's and the four variants are the port's. What decides each
// one is not the missing symbol but WHAT THE CALLER'S ARGUMENT IS:
//
//   - the two decode variants take a CMTaggedBufferGroup through their callback - a group of several images
//     for one frame, which arrived with iOS 14 - and the release's own decode callback has no parameter to
//     receive one: the 16.4 SDK's VTDecompressionOutputCallback ends at CVImageBuffer imageBuffer. A
//     callback the release cannot call is a block the port would have to call itself, and a port that called
//     it would be inventing the multi-image decode it has no decoder for. So both refuse with the release's
//     own decoder code and do no work;
//   - the two encode variants take a CMTaggedBufferGroupRef as their SOURCE, and there is no release
//     function that reads one: the release's encode entry point takes a CVImageBuffer. Same answer, with
//     the encoder's own code.
//
// kVTVideoDecoderNotAvailableNowErr and kVTVideoEncoderNotAvailableNowErr are the release's own constants
// (VTErrors.h:42 and :45) and they are what the same argument earned for the 9.0 output-handler pair, which
// this branch already refuses in VTSessionOutputHandler9_0.m. A variant that accepted its argument and did
// nothing with it would be the silent fake the brief forbids; a variant that refuses says so in the status,
// before any work, and the caller sees it.

// VTDecompressionSessionSetMultiImageCallback, and this one does NOT refuse.
//
// The first version answered kVTVideoDecoderNotAvailableNowErr (-12913) on the reasoning that the release's
// decode callback ends at CVImageBuffer and so could never reach the callback it is given. MEASURED on this
// host, 2026-10-03, on an ORDINARY single-image H264 session with no key and no special decoder:
// **VTDecompressionSessionSetMultiImageCallback answers 0**. So a caller that did nothing unusual is told the
// installation worked, and a port that answered -12913 would refuse a call the release accepts - the worse
// direction of the two, because the caller is told no where the real thing says yes.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, and the difference is named rather than papered over. The second version of this
// function stored the callback and its reference value in a process-global table keyed by the session's
// ADDRESS. That table was wrong twice over and is gone: it is never emptied when a session dies, so it
// leaks; and an address is not an identity, so a later session allocated at the same address would be handed
// a callback it was never given - the same hazard a release-local allocator raises and the one a stored
// pointer into a dead object always does. A second reason it was wrong: nothing read it.
//
// So this accepts the callback, stores nothing, and answers noErr, and here is precisely what a caller gets
// that the host's caller would not. The 26.2 header says of the installed callback: "When installed,
// outputMultiImageCallback will also be used when DecodeFrame operations fail and return a nonzero status."
// On the host that is true. **On the port a failing decode still reaches the session's single-image
// callback**, because the session is the RELEASE's session and the release's decode output has no
// multi-image parameter to carry the failure anywhere else. A caller that installed the callback to watch
// for failures will not see them, and that is the difference - stated here and in the registry row rather than
// hidden behind a table that would have looked like the installation worked.

// MEASURED on this host with a REAL H264 sample, 2026-10-03 - a 221-byte avc1 frame at 64x48, encoded here
// and handed over by an H264 compression session, because a NULL sample buffer makes every variant answer
// the same -12902 as plain DecodeFrame and measures nothing:
//
//   decompression session                                    -> 0 with a session
//   DecodeFrameWithMultiImageCapableOutputHandler             -> -12902  handler calls=0 infoFlags=0x5a5a5a5a
//   DecodeFrame (the control, same session, same sample)      -> 0  single-image calls=1  infoFlags=0
//
// So the host REFUSES with kVTParameterErr (-12902), does not call the handler, and does not write
// infoFlagsOut - the word handed in came back as 0x5a5a5a5a. It is a refusal about the variant and not about
// the session or the sample: the control decode on the same session answers noErr and fires the callback.
// Its own header says "If the VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrameWithMultiImageCapableOutputHandler call
// returns an error, the block will not be called", so refusing is the documented shape of the answer.

// the callback count is CUMULATIVE across the probe's two compression sessions - the first session's own
// successful encode is calls=1 - so this frame's contribution is exactly one call.
//
// What this port cannot reproduce is the call. The session is the RELEASE's session and the caller's output
// callback is inside it, with no public route out: the release's own encode refuses to make the call on
// request, which is measured - `EncodeFrame(NULL image)` answers -12902 with ZERO callbacks and leaves
// infoFlagsOut untouched - so there is no release call whose effect is "call the caller's callback once with
// -12902". So this reproduces the two things the host does that a caller can read, noErr and the dropped
// frame, and NOT the third, and the registry row says so in those words.
