// The multi-pass trio of VideoToolbox's session entry points, and what each honestly answers on a
// release whose sessions are the 6.1.3 ones. Their answer is read out of the session rather than
// assumed. VTCompressionSession.h says of each: "It is an error to call this function when multi-pass
// encoding has not been enabled by setting kVTCompressionPropertyKey_MultiPassStorage." Multi-pass
// arrived with iOS 9.0 and the 6.1.3 encoder has no such property, so every one of the three is being
// called in the case the header calls an error - but "the port cannot support multi-pass" is a claim
// about the release, and the release can be ASKED: VTSessionCopyProperty with
// kVTCompressionPropertyKey_MultiPassStorage answers NULL on a session that was never given one. That
// query is what these three do, and its answer is what they report.
//
// The two output-handler variants cannot be made to work at all, and the cause is a measured absence of
// API rather than a difficulty:
//
//   VTCompressionSessionEncodeFrameWithOutputHandler "Cannot be called with a session created with a
//   VTCompressionOutputCallback", and VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrameWithOutputHandler "Cannot be
//   called with a session created with a VTDecompressionOutputCallbackRecord". Both say the caller
//   therefore creates the session with a NULL callback and passes a block per call. But the callback is
//   fixed at VTCompressionSessionCreate / VTDecompressionSessionCreate time and NO API CHANGES IT
//   AFTERWARDS: there is no VTCompressionSessionSetOutputCallback and no
//   VTDecompressionSessionSetOutputCallback in the 16.4 SDK this port builds against, nor in the 26.2
//   SDK - measured, grep over both header sets, zero hits for either name. So the port can start the
//   encode, and there is no way for it to route the encoder's output to the block the caller handed in.
//
// What it does instead is the release's own behaviour for a session with no output callback: the frame
// is encoded and the compressed sample has nowhere to go. The encode's own status is passed back
// unchanged, because the encode really did happen. The block is not called, and no block is not a
// failure the caller can see - which is why the effect in registry/VideoToolbox/ios26.json says so
// plainly and why the entry is written up for coordination/crutches.md rather than left as an effect
// field nobody reads.

// The one query all three share, and the answer is per session rather than per process: two sessions in
// one process can be in different states, and a module-level flag would answer for both.
