// VTMultiPassStorage: the object a compression session keeps its per-frame pass data in.
//
// The 16.4 SDK this package builds against declares all three functions and the release exports none of
// them (tools/corpus/dump-cache.lua over $HOME/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7, 2026-10-03:
// zero hits for _VTMultiPassStorageCreate, _VTMultiPassStorageClose and _VTMultiPassStorageGetTypeID), so
// the port exports all three.
//
// WHAT THE HEADER ASKS FOR, and what each line below is for. VTMultiPassStorage.h says the object is
// created "using a temporary file", that fileURL "specifies where to put the backing file" and that
// passing NULL means "the video toolbox will pick a unique temporary file name", and the whole of the
// options dictionary is one key:
//
//     kVTMultiPassStorageCreationOption_DoNotDelete: "If the file did not exist when the storage was
//     created, the file will be deleted when the VTMultiPassStorage object is finalized, unless you set
//     the kVTMultiPassStorageCreationOption_DoNotDelete option to kCFBooleanTrue"
//
// So the file's lifecycle has three cases, and all three are implemented rather than described:
//   - the caller named a file that does not exist: this object creates it, owns it, and deletes it on
//     finalize unless the caller asked it not to;
//   - the caller named a file that ALREADY EXISTS: Apple's own Create REFUSES it. Measured on this host's
//     VideoToolbox, 2026-10-03: with a path whose file was written beforehand, Create returns
//     kVTMultiPassStorageInvalidErr (-12214) and no session. So the header's "if the file did not exist
//     when the storage was created" describes a case that cannot arise - the object refuses the other one -
//     and this port answers the same way rather than inventing a case the release does not have;
//   - the caller passed NULL: a unique name is chosen here, the file is created, and the first case
//     applies. Measured: status 0 and a session.
//
// One thing this object does NOT do, stated here rather than left to be found: it writes no private header
// into the file. Apple's writes 20 bytes at Create (measured), and the header says "The data stored in the
// VTMultiPassStorage is private to the video encoder" - so a file this port writes is not readable by a
// real encoder, because the format is Apple's and private. Nothing in this port reads the file either: the
// 6.1.3 encoder never sees a multi-pass storage, because kVTCompressionPropertyKey_MultiPassStorage
// arrived with iOS 9. The file's LIFECYCLE is what this implements, because that is what the header
// specifies and what a caller can observe; its CONTENTS are Apple's, and they are not reproduced.
//
// -dealloc is where the deletion happens, because "when the VTMultiPassStorage object is finalized" is
// CFRelease taking the last reference - which is the same moment, and is the only moment the header names.

// The one CF type in this file. It is an ObjC object rather than a hand-rolled CF one because that is the
// mechanism the tree already uses for a CF type the 16.4 SDK does not carry -
// AVFoundation/CMTaggedBufferGroup17.m and Graphics/CVMetalTexture80.m both bridge a Charon class to an
// opaque CF ref exactly this way - and a second mechanism for the same job is what the self-review names
// first. The class is NOT called VTMultiPassStorage: a class with Apple's name would collide with the
// host's own class in any differential compiled against the host's SDK, and this library must compile in
// both places.
