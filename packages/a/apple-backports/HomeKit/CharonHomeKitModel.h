// What the HomeKit model files share: how a record is read out of the store and written back, how a
// delegate message is delivered the way HomeKit delivers it, and how an error of HMErrorDomain is
// made. Every declaration here is the port's own name, so nothing in this header is API.
//
// **Where the model lives.** iOS 6 runs no home hub, no homekitd and no accessories daemon, so there
// is no system service to ask for a home graph. The port keeps the graph itself, in
// CharonHomeKitStore, and the objects the application sees are windows onto it: a name changed
// through HMHome is in the store before -updateName:completionHandler: calls back, and a graph
// written by one launch is there for the next. That is what makes the store real rather than a
// cache of what the process happens to be holding.
//
// **Where an accessory's own values come from.** A characteristic's value, whether an accessory is
// reachable and a camera's stream state are the accessory's, and the port reaches them over the
// HAP transport (CharonHAPTransport.h). Until a pair-setup has paired an accessory this port has
// no session with it, so the transport reports HMErrorCodeAccessoryNotReachable for a read or a
// write; what the graph itself knows -- names, rooms, the services and characteristics an accessory
// advertises, the action sets and triggers -- is answered from the store, and answered the same way
// on every launch.
