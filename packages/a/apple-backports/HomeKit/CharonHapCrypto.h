// What HAP pairs with, over a vetted library for the parts that are curves or ciphers and over this
// package's own code for the parts that are HomeKit's.
//
// **The curves and the AEAD are Monocypher's** (4.0.2, BSD-2-Clause OR CC0-1.0, vendored at
// packages/m/monocypher): X25519 for the pair-verify key agreement, Ed25519 for the pair-setup and
// pair-verify signatures, and `crypto_aead_lock` with `crypto_aead_init_ietf` — which is
// ChaCha20-Poly1305 with the 12-byte nonce HAP's session keys use, and not the XChaCha20-Poly1305
// Monocypher's own `crypto_aead` is. BLAKE2b is there too, and is not used: HAP derives with
// HKDF-SHA-512 and HKDF-SHA-256, which are SHA-2, and iOS 6's CommonCrypto has SHA-2 and HMAC-SHA-2.
//
// **SRP-6a is this package's own**, on `CharonHAPBignum`'s modular exponentiation, which is checked
// against an independent implementation on 72 primes from 32 to 3072 bits. It is written here rather
// than vendored because it is a hundred lines of exponentiation and hashing over a modexp that is
// already verified here, and a vendored SRP would be a second, unverified answer to a question this
// package can already answer correctly. The group is RFC 5054's 3072-bit one, which is the group HAP
// documents.
//
// Nothing in this file is API: every entry point is the port's own name.
