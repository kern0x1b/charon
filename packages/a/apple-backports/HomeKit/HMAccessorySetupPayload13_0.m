// HMAccessorySetupPayload, of iOS 13.0: the initialiser that takes the accessory's ownership token
// along with its setup payload URL.
//
// One release's API per object file. This file is of 13.0 alone; the 11.3 initialiser of the same class
// is a separate object in HMAccessorySetupPayload11_3.m, and a band from 13.0 up links both, because the
// 11.3 one is API the device has and this one is API added to it.
//
// The 26.2 header, HMAccessorySetupPayload.h:48-57:
//   /*! Creates a new accessory setup payload to add an accessory to the home.
//    * @param setupPayloadURL The HomeKit setup payload URL for the accessory being added to the home.`
//    * @param ownershipToken The token proving ownership of the accessory being added to the home.
//    * @return Returns an accessory setup payload object if successful or nil on error. */
//   - (nullable instancetype)initWithURL:(NSURL *)setupPayloadURL
//                    ownershipToken:(nullable HMAccessoryOwnershipToken *)ownershipToken
//        API_AVAILABLE(ios(13.0))API_UNAVAILABLE(macos, watchos, tvos);
//
// **The difference from 11.3 is the token, and it is a difference in what a device can check.** With the
// token the device can prove the caller owns the accessory before it adds it; without one it adds the
// accessory on the strength of the setup code alone. The port records which of the two a payload was
// made with, and records the token opaquely, because HMAccessoryOwnershipToken is a class the port does
// not carry -- see the facts file -- and there is nothing here that could make one.
//
// **What the port cannot do.** Verifying that the token proves ownership is the accessory's and the
// daemon's work; the port has neither the accessory nor a HomeKit transport, so it neither sends the
// token anywhere nor opens a connection. Nothing in this file touches the network or a real HomeKit store
// on this machine.

// A CATEGORY, not a second @implementation: two objects linked into one binary cannot both define
// the class (the 6.1.3 gate stopped on duplicate _OBJC_CLASS_$_HMAccessorySetupPayload), so the object that
// holds the class is the 11.3 one and this adds the 13.0 initialiser to it. The token's storage is that
// object's, declared in the shared header; the token is held as the SDK's own type and read only for its
// presence, because the port does not carry HMAccessoryOwnershipToken and cannot inspect one - copying its
// bytes would claim a check the port never made. A nil token is not an error, the header types it nullable.
