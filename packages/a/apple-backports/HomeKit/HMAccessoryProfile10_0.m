// HMAccessoryProfile, of iOS 10.0, and HMCameraProfile, the 10.0 subclass of it: what an accessory
// publishes about itself.
//
// One object per release: this file is of 10.0 alone.
//
// A profile is a description, not a device. `uniqueIdentifier` is the profile's own, `services` are the
// accessory's services as the profile lists them, and `accessory` is the accessory it belongs to - a weak
// reference, because the profile does not keep the accessory alive, exactly as the header says.
//
// The 26.2 header, HMAccessoryProfile.h:19-20, 27, 32, 37:
//   HM_EXTERN NS_SWIFT_SENDABLE API_AVAILABLE(ios(10.0), watchos(3.0), tvos(10.0), macCatalyst(14.0))
//       API_UNAVAILABLE(macos);
//   @interface HMAccessoryProfile : NSObject
//     @property (nonatomic, readonly, copy) NSUUID *uniqueIdentifier;          line 27
//     @property (nonatomic, readonly, strong) NSArray<HMService *> *services;   line 32
//     @property (nonatomic, readonly, weak) HMAccessory *accessory;            line 37
// None of the three is nullable, and that is what the contract check asserts: a profile that answered nil
// for a property the header types as nonnull would be answering something the release does not.
//
// HMCameraProfile, HMCameraProfile.h:25-26, subclasses this one and adds four optional controls:
//   @property (nullable, nonatomic, readonly, strong) HMCameraStreamControl *streamControl;    line 33
//   @property (nullable, nonatomic, readonly, strong) HMCameraSnapshotControl *snapshotControl; line 38
//   @property (nullable, nonatomic, readonly, strong) HMCameraSettingsControl *settingsControl;  line 43
//   @property (nullable, nonatomic, readonly, strong) HMCameraAudioControl *speakerControl;     line 48
// All four are **nullable**, unlike the three above, and that difference is the property's own: an
// accessory's camera does not have to publish every control, and nil is how it says which.
//
// A profile is made the way the release makes the objects it has no public initialiser for: the header
// declares none for this class, and the graph's own entry point is the one place a profile is created, so
// -charon_initWithStore:identifier: on this class is that path and the accessory's accessor reuses it
// rather than building a second kind of profile.

#import <HomeKit/HomeKit.h>

#import "CharonHomeKitInternal.h"
#import "CharonHomeKitConstruction.h"
#import "CharonHomeKitStore.h"

// The four camera controls exist in the SDK and the port does not carry them, so a camera profile's four
// controls are answered as nil - which is what the header's nullable allows and what an accessory that
// publishes no control says. Each is named here so the reason is in one place.
