// CGAnimateImageAtURLWithBlock and CGAnimateImageDataWithBlock: the animation pair, over the release's own
// CGImageSource, which is what decodes and indexes the frames.
//
// WHICH RELEASE THIS OBJECT IS: 16.0, and it is a new object of a family GraphicsBackports already has
// twenty-eight objects of. tools/cache-index/first-rung.py over the 50 held rungs puts
// _CGAnimateImageAtURLWithBlock, _CGAnimateImageDataWithBlock and the three kCGImageAnimation... names at
// 16.0 and on no rung below it, which is what makes this a 16.0-band object and not a 13.0 one: the SDK
// annotates the pair 13.0, and the ladder the answer comes from has no rung between 13.0 and 16.0. It is not
// a split of anything already carried - nothing else in the tree defines either function.
//
// WHAT IT DOES, AND EVERY PART OF IT MEASURED ON THE HOST'S OWN ImageIO on 2026-10-03
// (tests/backports/host/imageio-animate/, which builds this object and the host's ImageIO into two
// programs and compares them case by case):
//
//   * THE FUNCTION RETURNS BEFORE THE FIRST FRAME IS DRAWN, unless there is only one frame. Measured: for
//     a two- and a three-frame file the host answers 0 with no call at all and the first call arrives within
//     a millisecond of that return, while a ONE-frame file has its frame drawn inside the call and a loop
//     count of three still draws it once. So the animation is a timer on the main run loop and not a loop
//     here: the header's "The block is called on the main queue at time intervals specified by the delay
//     time of the image".
//   * THE FRAME ORDER IS THE FILE'S, and it wraps: index 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, ... for a three-frame file, and the
//     block is handed the frame the release's own CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex decodes at that index
//     (the harness compares the pixels, not only the index).
//   * EACH FRAME IS GIVEN ITS OWN DELAY, read out of that frame's own {GIF} dictionary: a file whose
//     frames declare 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 seconds is drawn with gaps of 0.104, 0.301 and 0.507 measured. The
//     delay that decides is kCGImagePropertyGIFDelayTime and not kCGImagePropertyGIFUnclampedDelayTime: a
//     file written with a delay of 0.005 answers DelayTime 0.1 and UnclampedDelayTime 0.01 and is drawn at
//     0.104. A frame with no delay at all answers 0.1, which is ImageIO's own default and needs nothing
//     here to invent it.
//   * IT LOOPS FOREVER unless kCGImageAnimationLoopCount says otherwise: one loop of a three-frame file is
//     exactly three calls and two loops are exactly six. The GIF dictionary's own kCGImagePropertyGIFLoopCount
//     is NOT read - a file that says "loop forever" and a file that says "one loop" both animate forever
//     when no option is given (measured, both).
//   * kCGImageAnimationStartIndex is read: 1 on a three-frame file draws 1, 2, 0, 1. A negative index draws
//     from 0, which is what the host does.
//   * kCGImageAnimationDelayTime IS READ OUT AND NOT USED, because the host ignores it: a file whose frames
//     declare 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 is drawn at 0.104/0.301/0.507 with the option set to 0.02 and at the same
//     0.104/0.301/0.507 with it set to 2.0 (measured, both, with the option's own value printed). The
//     frame's own delay wins, so this follows the host rather than the header's sentence about the option.
//   * *stop ENDS THE ANIMATION: set on the second of three calls, the third never comes.
//   * THE STATUS: 0 for a GIF, including a one-frame one, which is drawn once. -22141
//     (kCGImageAnimationStatus_CorruptInputImage) for a source that is not an animation - a PNG, a JPEG and
//     a THREE-FRAME TIFF all answer it with no call at all, so a frame count is not what decides it and
//     the {GIF} dictionary of the first frame is. -50 (paramErr) for a NULL url or NULL data. A NULL block
//     answers 0 and the block is never called, which is this: the block is drawn once per frame and there
//     is nothing to call.
//
// THE ONE PLACE THE PORT DOES NOT COPY THE HOST: a kCGImageAnimationStartIndex at or past the frame count.
// The host answers 0 and then TRAPS (SIGTRAP, exit 133, measured on this Mac for index 2 on a two-frame
// file and for index 9) when its first frame is read. A trap is not a behaviour to carry, so this object
// answers 0 and calls nothing, which is the same status with the block never running; the harness declares
// that one case and says why in known-differences.txt.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, and says so here rather than in a commit: an APNG. The header names GIF and APNG as
// the supported formats, and a release whose ImageIO carries no APNG decoder cannot decode one, so the frame
// this object draws is whatever the release's own source hands back. The status for a file the release
// cannot read is the -22141 above.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <ImageIO/ImageIO.h>

// -50 is paramErr (MacTypes.h), which is what the host answers for a NULL url and for NULL data. It is
// written here because the OSStatus this file returns is not a CFError and the constant is not in ImageIO.
#define CHARON_ANIMATION_PARAM_ERR (-50)

// What the port carries and the release does not export below the band this object is for:
// Graphics/ImageIONames130.m holds all three (first exported by the 16.0 caches, the SDK says 13.0), and
// this object is compiled in every band that compiles that one, so the symbols resolve in every band.
