// The sec_protocol_metadata family, from Security/SecProtocolMetadata.h.
//
// THE OBJECT IS THE PORT'S OWN, exactly as the preprocessor emits the type:
//
//     @protocol OS_sec_protocol_metadata <NSObject> @end
//     typedef NSObject<OS_sec_protocol_metadata> * __attribute__((objc_independent_class))
//         sec_protocol_metadata_t;
//
// NOTHING IN 6.1.3 EVER PRODUCES ONE, and that is the whole of this family. A sec_protocol_metadata_t is
// handed to a TLS callback by the handshake that negotiated it, and 6.1.3 has no TLS stack that calls
// one: the release's networking is not this API. So the object exists because the rows are callable, and
// every getter answers the header's absence.
//
// THE CLASS IS DELIBERATELY EMPTY OF NEGOTIATED VALUES, and there is nothing to put in it: there is no
// setter anywhere in this header, so a held ciphersuite or version would be a value the port invented
// with no caller able to have set it. An empty object and a getter that says so is the honest shape; a
// held value here would be a number that looks negotiated and is not.
