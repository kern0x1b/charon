// SecTrustSetPolicies is the one that shapes this file: it is 6.0, so the setter a caller reached is
// the RELEASE'S on 6.1.3 and there is no release call that reads the policies back. Which is why the
// two trust copy-accessors below report what the PORT was handed and say plainly in their effect
// fields that they cannot report what the caller set through the release's own setter - the port
// never sees that call happen. The 4.3 band, which has no setter at all, therefore gets the same
// answer as a caller who never set anything, which is right.
//
// ONE OBJECT PER RELEASE. Everything here is __IPHONE_7_0; this family's 8.0, 11.0, 12.1.1, 13.0 and
// 15.0 rows live in files of their own, which tools/release-split.lua checks.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The two holds.
//
// The POLICY hold exists because SecPolicyCreateWithProperties below is a function this port
// DEFINES. A caller that goes through it hands the port the properties and the identifier, so the port
// can hand both back: SecPolicyCopyProperties then returns the caller's own dictionary plus the OID of
// the release creator the port called. That is a round trip, not a reconstruction.
//
// The TRUST hold holds what the port's OWN setters were given. It cannot hold what a caller passed to
// the release's setters, because the port does not define them and never sees those calls; the two
// copy-accessors below are written for exactly that limit.

// There is NO trust hold, and the absence is the measurement: SecTrustSetPolicies, SecTrustSetAnchor-
// Certificates and SecTrustSetAnchorCertificatesOnly are the RELEASE'S functions on both releases, so a
// caller's set call never reaches this port and there is nothing here it could be handed. The two
// copy-accessors below are written for exactly that limit.

// so the port never sees that call happen. Nothing on 6.1.3 can report which policies a trust was
// given: no call returns them and no field of the trust exposes them.
//
// SO THE PORT ANSWERS errSecSuccess and an EMPTY array, always. THE EFFECT IS STATED because an empty
// array is a claim a caller could misread, and here it is the whole of the answer: it does NOT mean
// "this trust has no policies", it means 6.1.3 cannot be asked which policies a trust was given. A
// caller that set three policies through the release's own setter gets none of them back, while the
// evaluation is unaffected - the release resolves against the very array the caller passed. The host,
// asked the same question over the same trust, answers the caller's one policy, and that difference

// claim to be a list of anchors that is empty, while NULL claims only that this call reports none, and

//
// WHAT 6.1.3 ANSWERS: the verdict and nothing else. SecTrustEvaluate is iOS 2.0 and writes a
// SecTrustResultType, and no call on 6.1.3 reads a result DICTIONARY back - there is no stored result
// for a reader to be stale or fresh about, the same fact facts/Security/SecTrustGetTrustResult.md
// records for the accessor of that name.
//
// So this dictionary is BUILT, and it carries the two keys the release can answer and no others:
//
//   kSecTrustResultValue     the release's own SecTrustEvaluate verdict, read out of that call
//   kSecTrustEvaluationDate  the moment of that evaluation, which for this port is the moment of this
//                            call
//
// The keys SecTrust.h documents besides those two are ABSENT, and their absence is measured rather
// than assumed. The host's own dictionary over the committed fixture certificate, printed key by key,
// carries TrustResultDetails, TrustResultValue, TrustEvaluationDate and TrustEvaluationID; of those
// only TrustResultValue and TrustEvaluationDate are keys SecTrust.h declares (:163-178), and neither
// of the other two has a row in this family because no SDK header declares them. SecTrust.h:124-136
// documents every declared key as conditional ("will be present IF ...", "only valid for a revocation
// policy"), and 6.1.3 has no call reporting extended validation, an organization name or a revocation
// answer, so a caller wanting one of those gets nil for its key rather than a value this port invented.
//
// THE ONE NAMED DIFFERENCE from the host: the host's TrustResultDetails is a dictionary of
// per-certificate status codes (AnchorTrusted, StatusCodes) and 6.1.3 exposes no per-certificate status
// accessor at all, so there is nothing here that could fill it. That is stated rather than papered
// over with an empty dictionary under a key a caller would read as a real answer.

// SecPolicyCopyProperties, SecPolicy.h:146-159, __OSX_AVAILABLE_STARTING(__MAC_10_7, __IPHONE_7_0).
//
// WHAT 6.1.3 ANSWERS. It HAS the policy object and NOT the accessor: both creators are __IPHONE_2_0
// and exported by both releases (SecPolicyCreateBasicX509 :167, SecPolicyCreateSSL :180), and
// SecPolicyGetTypeID (:143) is __IPHONE_2_0 as well - but neither release has a call that reads a
// policy's properties back, and a SecPolicyRef carries no readable state. CFEqual does not answer it
// either, and that is measured rather than assumed: on the host two separately created basic X.509
// policies compare equal (1), a basic and an SSL policy do not (0), two SSL server policies with the
// same host do (1) and two with different hosts do not (0) - so equality identifies a policy only for
// a caller prepared to build every candidate, which is a guess with extra steps.
//
// SO THE PORT ANSWERS, for a policy that came through the port's own SecPolicyCreateWithProperties,
// the OID of the creator the port called plus the keys the caller passed: a real round trip, since the
// dictionary read back is the dictionary passed with the OID added. The two OID strings are the HOST'S
// own answers for those two creators, measured on this Mac by SecPolicyCopyProperties over each - a
// basic X.509 policy answers one key, SecPolicyOid = 1.2.840.113635.100.1.2, and an SSL policy answers
// SecPolicyOid = 1.2.840.113635.100.1.3 - and kSecPolicyAppleX509Basic and kSecPolicyAppleSSL carry
// exactly those two strings already (SecurityNames70.m).
//
// FOR A POLICY THE PORT NEVER SAW - a caller that called SecPolicyCreateBasicX509 or SecPolicyCreateSSL
// directly, which is the ordinary way to make a policy on this release - this answers NULL. NULL is
// the header's own nullable result (:157-158) and the only honest answer: 6.1.3 holds no properties

// WHAT 6.1.3 ANSWERS: the two policies it can make and NULL for everything else. Its policy creators

// exported by 6.1.3 and 4.3 - and there is no third. So this maps the identifier onto the release's own
// creator rather than building a policy of its own:
//
//   kSecPolicyAppleX509Basic -> SecPolicyCreateBasicX509(), OID kSecPolicyAppleX509Basic
//   kSecPolicyAppleSSL       -> SecPolicyCreateSSL(server, hostname), OID kSecPolicyAppleSSL
//   anything else            -> NULL, which is the header's own answer for "could not be created"
//
// `server` is the absence of kSecPolicyClient: SecPolicy.h:110-113 documents kSecPolicyClient as "a
// CFBooleanRef value that indicates this evaluation should be for a client certificate", so a policy
// carrying it is a client policy and SecPolicyCreateSSL's `server` argument is false. That mapping is
// the host's too and was measured: the host's own SSL client policy answers a two-key properties
// dictionary carrying kSecPolicyClient, and its server policy without a host answers a one-key
// dictionary that does not.
//
// `hostname` is kSecPolicyName, which SecPolicy.h:111-115 documents as "a CFStringRef (or CFArrayRef
// of same) containing a name which must be matched in the certificate", and the first element of the
// array is the one SecPolicyCreateSSL's single CFStringRef argument can carry.
//
// THE EFFECTS, both stated because a caller can be misled by either. The identifier: only the two
// above are created, so kSecPolicyAppleSMIME, kSecPolicyAppleEAP, kSecPolicyAppleIPsec,
// kSecPolicyAppleRevocation, kSecPolicyAppleCodeSigning and the rest answer NULL here where the host
// answers a policy - the host was asked and answered, and the host's own answer for each of them is in
// facts/Security/AbsentRows613.md; 6.1.3 has no creator to build them with, so the honest answer is
// the header's documented failure. The properties: kSecPolicyName and kSecPolicyClient are honoured,
// because they are what the release's creator takes, and kSecPolicyRevocationFlags and
