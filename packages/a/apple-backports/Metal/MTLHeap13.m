// The 13.0 members: a heap's type, hazard tracking and resource options, the two offset-taking
// allocations a placement heap exists for, and the encoders' staged form of naming heaps.
//
// A resource placed at an offset the application chose is a view into the heap's bytes at that
// offset, so `usedSize` reaches past it and the next automatic allocation starts after it, and two
// placements that overlap are the application's own doing: Metal leaves that undefined, and so does
// the port, except that the second one is refused when it does not fit.
//
// `stages` says which stages of a pipeline may read the heaps, and this port has one stage set: a
// command is a call into OpenGL ES 2.0 that has already been made, so every heap is visible to
// every stage and the mask changes nothing. facts/Metal/Heaps.md says so rather than leaving the
// argument ignored silently.
//
// The heap descriptor is the SDK's own class, so `type`, `resourceOptions` and the rest are its own
// properties with its own storage: there is nothing for the port to write here.
