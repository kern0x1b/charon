// A heap is one allocation that resources are taken out of, and on this device that is literally what
// it is: a calloc of the size the descriptor asks for, and every resource made from the heap is a
// range of those bytes. That is not a stand-in for a GPU heap, it is the whole of what a heap can be
// where every resource is already CPU memory, and it is why the accounting is exact rather than
// approximate: `usedSize` is the offset the next allocation starts at, `currentAllocatedSize` is the
// sum of what was handed out, and an explicit offset is the offset asked for, once it is aligned and
// once it is in range.
//
// Apple's documented alignment of a heap allocation is 256 bytes. It is named here rather than
// measured, because it is a property of Metal's heaps and not of this device, and nothing an
// application can observe here depends on the exact value beyond the offsets it asks for: an offset
// that is a multiple of 256 is also a multiple of 16, which is the largest alignment any ARMv7
// allocation needs. facts/Metal/Heaps.md says where the number comes from and what would change.
