// A shared event is a signal value and the wait that blocks until it is reached. The port keeps the
// value and the wait as real state on the CPU: a fence on this device is not a piece of work in
// flight, since the port issues each command as it is encoded, so the value an encoder captures is
// the value the work it had encoded has already reached, and a wait for it returns at once. What a
// caller can still do with a real event is signal a value itself and wait for a value another thread
// signals, and both of those are what this implements.
//
// The value and the wait live in a state of their own, and a handle names that state rather than the
// event: -newSharedEventWithHandle: hands back a different object over the same value, which is what
// opening an event elsewhere is. What a handle cannot do here is cross a process, because the port
// runs one; that is the whole of what it cannot do, and -newSharedEventWithHandle: on a handle of
// another device's event is refused with a line in the log rather than silently opening nothing.
