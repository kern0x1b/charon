// THE PROTOCOL'S TWO COMMITS ARE NOT IN THIS FILE, and clang says so - twice, once per method - because this
// class adopts @protocol MTL4CommandQueue and their rows -[MTL4CommandQueue commit:count:] and
// -[MTL4CommandQueue commit:count:options:] are `owed` until Metal/MTL4CommandBuffer26.m exists. **Those two
// warnings are the truth and they stay visible**: they are how a reader of a build log sees that two required
// members of an adopted protocol are owed, and the wave's rule is that no new diagnostic pragma goes into a
// port file. The gate counts errors and a warning is not one - land-w14 went through with four of the same
// warning in MetalPerformanceShaders/MPSGraphExecutionDescriptor14.m - so nothing here is silenced to make a
// check pass. Defining either commit now would be the thing to hide: every buffer a caller could hand it would
// be refused, which is a row claiming work the port cannot do.
#import "CharonMetal.h"
#import "CharonMetal26Types.h"
// THE TRANSCRIBED @protocol MTL4CommandQueue, which the 16.4 SDK this file compiles against does not
// declare and which the class below adopts: facts only, written by tools/transcribe-protocols.py.
#import "CharonMetalProtocols.h"

// THE METAL 4 QUEUE, over the port's own CharonMetalQueue, which is the queue that works: it holds the
// EAGL context over OpenGL ES 2.0 that every draw in this port goes through. So a Metal 4 caller asking
// for a Metal 4 queue gets the same working queue a Metal 3 caller gets, with the two members the rows
// name on top. That is what makes the row honest - there is ONE queue in this port and it is the one
// that runs - and it is why this class adds members and not behaviour.
//
// It is a class rather than a conformance to @protocol MTL4CommandQueue because iOS 6 has no Metal 4
// protocol to conform to: the 26.2 headers declare the protocol and the surface's rows for its members
// are the class's.
//
// THE TWELVE MEMBERS BELOW ARE SORTED BY WHAT THIS BACKEND ACTUALLY IS, because a member that logs
// "refused" and returns is a stub and a row that calls that `implemented` is a row contradicting itself.
// Four groups, each with the facts line that puts its member where it is:
//
//  (a) **THE NO-OP IS THE RIGHT ANSWER, and it says nothing.** The four residency-set members and the two
//      drawable members. Every resource of this port is CPU-resident whatever the application asked for -
//      a buffer is its own bytes and a texture is read and written on the CPU
//      (facts/Metal/Blits.md, "The access hints", and facts/Metal/Heaps.md, "Hazard tracking and storage
//      modes") - so there is no residency a set could add and none it could take away, and a draw is a
//      call into OpenGL ES 2.0 that has already been made by the time it is encoded, so a drawable is
//      never waiting for anything and never waiting to be told. `-waitForDrawable:` says in its own
//      header that it "returns immediately and doesn't perform any synchronization on the current thread",
//      which is what this body is; `-signalDrawable:` schedules the signal that says rendering is
//      complete, and on this backend it already is. This is the same shape as
//      `-[MTLCommandBuffer optimizeContentsForCPUAccess:]` in facts/Metal/Blits.md: doing nothing,
//      because the performance it asks for is already the case. These rows are `implemented` and NO
//      member here prints a line.
//
//  (b) **DONE NATIVELY OVER THE PORT'S OWN OBJECTS.** `-signalEvent:value:` and `-waitForEvent:value:`,
//      over `CharonMetalSharedEvent`, whose state is a signalled value and a wait that blocks until it is
//      reached (Metal/MTLSharedEvent12.m). @protocol MTLSharedEvent is declared as a refinement of
//      MTLEvent in the 26.2 SDK (MTLEvent.h:52), so the port's own event IS an MTLEvent by shape. A GPU
//      event is signalled when the work before it is complete, and here the work before it is complete
//      by the time the call is encoded, for the same reason the hazard tracking above is not acted on.
//      These rows are `implemented` and the probe asks both of them on the guest.
//
//  (c) **NOT POSSIBLE ON THIS BACKEND, so `inert`.** The four sparse mapping members. A sparse mapping
//      needs an MTLHeap with a sparse residency mode and no heap this port makes is one:
//      `MTLHeapTypeSparse` is refused at creation with an error and a line in the log
//      (facts/Metal/Heaps.md, and registry/Metal/ios11heap.json), and facts/Metal/Heaps.md says why - "a
//      heap is already all of memory and is never paged". So there is no mapping to update and none to
//      copy. `inert` means "declared, does nothing, and says so once in the log the first time it is
//      used" (registry/README.md), which is what these four do through the helper below - the same shape
//      as `-[AUAudioUnit charon_noteInert:why:]` in Metal's sibling AVFAudio/AUAudioUnit9.m.
//
// facts/Metal/RenderPath.md is where the rendering path says what it does, and
// facts/Metal/CommandChain26.md is where the expectations and the runs live.
//
// **TWELVE OF THE PROTOCOL'S OWN MEMBERS ARE ON THIS CLASS, and they were on the DEVICE until the device
// probe found it.** Every method from -commit:count: down used to be written in the CharonMetalDevice
// category below, so all fourteen of them answered on the DEVICE and none on the queue - and a Metal 4
// caller holds a queue. Twelve are here now; the two commits are not, because they need a buffer this port
// does not carry, and the reason is at their place in the declaration below. It was found by running and
// not by reading: the device probe's case
// metalchain_commit_returns asks the queue for -commit:count: and the run of 2026-10-04 answered
// "FAIL metalchain_commit_returns: the queue answers -commit:count: (Apple's own queue does)", while the
// binary's own symbol table carries -[CharonMetalDevice(CharonMetal4CommandQueue26) commit:count:] and
// nothing of that name on the queue (tests/backports/device/metalchain-probe/run/run.log). The ledger
// agrees and was not guessing: all fourteen were status `missing` - they are the queue's members, so with
// none of them on the queue the queue did not exist as far as the corpus was concerned.
// **THE CLASS CONFORMS TO @protocol MTL4CommandQueue, and that is what makes the ten member rows
// answerable.** iOS 6 has no Metal 4 protocol to adopt, so the declaration is transcribed from the SDK that
// has it into CharonMetalProtocols.h (tools/transcribe-protocols.py, facts only), and this conformance is
// what makes clang emit __OBJC_PROTOCOL_$_MTL4CommandQueue with the protocol's method list into this object.
// The corpus asks for exactly that: MTL4CommandQueue is a `header-ok`, `needs lift` row. Without it the
// methods are the port's own names on a Charon* class and every row naming the protocol is a row nothing
// answers for - measured 2026-10-04, when the landing gate failed all ten with "listed as implemented, but
// nothing of that name is built" (the eight members below plus MTL4CommandQueue.device and .label).
// The generated per-band source MetalBackportsProtocols26.m then finds this conformance and does NOT force
// the object, which is the duplicate check modules/apple/backports.lua makes.
@interface CharonMetal4CommandQueue : NSObject <MTL4CommandQueue>
// THE LABEL IS READONLY AND ATOMIC, which is what MTL4CommandQueue.h:218 declares - `@property (readonly,
// nullable) NSString* label` - and atomic is the default a property has, so that is the spelling that matches
// the protocol's own and not a copy and not nonatomic. The label therefore arrives the way Metal 4 says it
// does, through the descriptor, and there is no setter for a caller to reach; -charonSetLabel: is the port's
// own seam for the one place that sets it, the same shape as -[MTLFunction charonCheckHeapOf:what:] and
// -[UIPasteboard charonRecordOptions:] and carrying its own registry row.
@property (atomic, readonly) NSString *label;
- (void)charonSetLabel:(NSString *)label;
// **-commit:count: AND -commit:count:options: ARE NOT HERE, and that is a dependency and not an
// oversight.** Both take an array of MTL4CommandBuffer, and this port carries no MTL4CommandBuffer: the
// buffer is the next family (Metal/MTL4CommandBuffer26.m does not exist yet) and every buffer a Metal 4
// caller could hand the commit would be "not one of this port's". A method that answers wrongly is worse
// than one that is absent, so the two rows -[MTL4CommandQueue commit:count:] and
// -[MTL4CommandQueue commit:count:options:] are status `owed` with the reason "waits on the
// MTL4CommandBuffer family", and check_registry holds a row that is not `implemented` to an answer the
// build does not give ("listed as absent, but what is built answers it"). They come back with the buffer.
