// THE METAL 4 RENDER PASS DESCRIPTOR, and it is the same kind of thing as the twenty-four classes
// beside it: a data holder that says what a pass is over and asks the device nothing.
//
// EVERY DEFAULT BELOW IS APPLE'S OWN, measured against a fresh object of Apple's class, and they are
// all zeros, nils and one NO - which is worth saying because it is the answer a reader would guess and
// this file measured it anyway: the colour attachments, the depth attachment and the stencil
// attachment are OBJECTS on a fresh pass, the rasterization rate map and the visibility result buffer
// are nil, and the colour attachment array is the SAME eight-slot array MTLRenderPassDescriptor's own
// uses (measured: Apple's own array answers indices 0 to 7 and index 8 fails the framework's
// assertion, out of process).
//
// WHAT A COMMAND ENCODER WOULD DO WITH ONE OF THESE IS NOT HERE, and that is the same half
// facts/Metal/Descriptors26.md records: this port vends no MTL4CommandQueue and no MTL4CommandBuffer,
// so an application that fills one gets an object it can read, copy and compare - and no object to
// hand it to.

// THE SAMPLE POSITIONS, which are the one member here that is an ARRAY rather than a number, and the
// two methods are its reader and its writer. Metal's own bound is the sample count, and the header
// says a `count` of 0 disables custom positions; the port keeps as many as it is given and refuses to
// write past its own storage rather than reading past the caller's.
// THE TWO SINGLE ATTACHMENTS ARE COMPARED MEMBER BY MEMBER HERE, and that is a measurement: neither
// MTLRenderPassDepthAttachmentDescriptor nor MTLRenderPassStencilAttachmentDescriptor carries an
// -isEqual: of its own - measured, their own method lists have neither it nor -hash - yet two fresh
// ones ARE equal on Apple's side and changing one's clearDepth makes them DIFFER. So Apple's render
// pass equality compares the members itself, and so does this one.
//
// THE COLOUR ATTACHMENTS ARE NOT COMPARED AT ALL, and that is measured the other way: Apple's
// MTLRenderPassColorAttachmentDescriptorArray carries no -isEqual: either, two fresh arrays are NOT
// equal, and two fresh MTL4RenderPassDescriptors ARE equal. An equality that compared the attachments
// could not answer that - the same shape as the tile pipeline's array, and for the same measured reason.

// THREE BOUNDS, ALL REFUSED THE SAME WAY, AND ALL THREE MEASURED off Apple's own assertions rather than
// read off the header. The earlier version of this file claimed three and ENFORCED ONE, which was the
// defect worth fixing here:
//
//   * THE COUNT MUST BE A VALID SAMPLE COUNT. Apple's own words: "count (3) is not a supported sample
//     count for custom positions. count must be 0, 2, 4 or 8." That is what MTL4RenderPass.h:107 means
//     by "This value needs to be a valid sample count".
//   * BOTH COORDINATES LIE IN [0, 1). Two separate assertions, one per axis, each captured from the
//     framework's own stderr and each with its own line number: x-coodicate (1.500000) at index 1 at
//     line 433, y-coodicate (1.500000) at index 1 at line 435. A negative coordinate is out of range at
//     the bottom of the interval and 1.5 at the top.
//   * A READ'S COUNT MUST MATCH WHAT IS PROGRAMMED. Apple's own words: "Non-zero count (2) does not match
//     the number of programmed custom sample positions (4)" - measured for a count SMALLER than the
//     programmed one as well as a larger one, and both are the same assertion. A count of ZERO is the
//     one that is always allowed: it is how a caller asks how many there are without room for them.
//
// Every one of them is refused the way the eight-slot arrays are refused: an NSException whose reason
// names the bound and the value. Metal's own refusals are assertions that stop the process, so the
// differential asks them OUT OF PROCESS and compares what each side printed - see
// tests/backports/host/metal-census/descriptors26-samplebounds.{m,sh}.
