// THE TILE RENDER PIPELINE'S COLOUR ATTACHMENTS, and they arrived with the SDK of iOS 11, so they are
// in an object of their own and not in MTL4Descriptors26.m: an object holds the API of ONE release,
// and these two classes are 11.0 while everything beside them is 26.0. The 16.4 SDK this package
// compiles against declares both, so there is nothing to transcribe - only bodies to write.
//
// THE HEADER DECLARES EXACTLY THREE MEMBERS between the two classes, and the port implements exactly
// those: the attachment's one property, pixelFormat, and the array's two indexed members. There is no
// -count, no -reset and no NSCopying on the array here, and the port does not add any.
//
// EIGHT SLOTS, measured against Apple's own array rather than read off a header: indices 0 to 7 answer
// a descriptor and index 8 fails the framework's own assertion. The measurement is out of process,
// one index per invocation, because that assertion STOPS the process - measured here, and it is the
// same shape as the four-slot measurement facts/Metal/Descriptors16.md records for the 14.0 family.
//
// A NIL AT A LEGAL INDEX RESETS the slot to the defaults, which is the header's own sentence: "It is
// safe to set the attachment state at any legal index to nil, which resets that attachment descriptor
// state to default values." The only default there is one member, and it is MTLPixelFormatInvalid.
