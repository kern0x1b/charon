// THE RASTERIZATION-RATE FAMILY, the part of it that is a plain data holder.
//
// A rasterization-rate MAP says how densely a render target is sampled: how many layers it has, and
// per layer a grid of sample rates. So the whole of it is numbers and two small containers, and none
// of it asks a device anything. THAT IS THE CASE FOR CARRYING IT, and it is why this unit needs no
// device: a caller building a map writes a layer count, a screen size and some sample rates, and
// reads the same numbers back.
//
// THE THREE CLASSES ARE MUTUALLY DEPENDENT and land together: the descriptor OWNS the layer array,
// and a layer descriptor OWNS the two sample arrays, so a map without them and a layer without its
// samples are not the family. MTLRasterizationRateMap - the object a device makes out of a map - is
// NOT here; it is a reader over device-made state and belongs with the device work.
//
// NO DEVICE IS CREATED anywhere in this file or its case: a descriptor asks a device nothing, which
// facts/Metal/DeviceOnThisMachine.md measures.
