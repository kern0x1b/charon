// THE DESCRIPTORS THAT ARRIVED IN iOS 16, and they are the same kind of thing as the twenty in
// MTLDescriptors14.m: plain data holders that say what a pass or a queue is built FROM and ask the
// device nothing. That is the whole case for carrying them, and it is why the three acceleration
// structure pass descriptors - which are MTLComputePassDescriptor's own family member for member,
// without the dispatch type - were not left absent while their compute, render and resource-state
// siblings are carried.
//
// NOTHING HERE CREATES A DEVICE, and the host differential is built on that. Each side is
// `[[X alloc] init]`, the port's class and Apple's, and a descriptor asks a device nothing - which
// facts/Metal/DeviceOnThisMachine.md measures - so no case in this file creates one.
//
// THE SAMPLE BUFFER EACH ATTACHMENT CARRIES IS A DEVICE-MADE OBJECT and this port makes none - not
// this release's and not the port's - but the DESCRIPTOR's handling of one is measured, because a
// device to make one with is no longer a wall: tests/backports/host/metal-census/descriptors16.sh
// makes a real MTLCounterSampleBuffer on Apple's own device (the timestamp counter set,
// MTLCounters.h:65), hands that one object to both sides, and compares what each returns, what each
// copy carries, and what each side's array holds after the attachment goes through it and a nil takes
// it away again. 57 checks (43 before this section), and the reset mutant M7 is the one only that section can
// catch. What is
// still NOT measured is what a sample buffer's CONTENTS are, which needs a command encoder this port
// vends no ray tracing path for; facts/Metal/Descriptors16.md says so.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE, and it is the half a caller has to know: this port vends no acceleration
// structure command encoder and no IO command queue, so nothing in it ever reads a descriptor made
// here. `-[MTLCommandBuffer accelerationStructureCommandEncoderWithDescriptor:]` and
// `-[MTLDevice newIOQueueWithDescriptor:error:]` are Metal facilities this release's GPU has not, and
// a caller that builds one of these descriptors gets an object it can read and no object to hand it
// to. The five MTLIO* protocols and the mesh pipeline descriptor are the rows that stay absent for
// that reason, and their reasons say which facility is missing rather than that the class arrived
// late.
//
// EVERY VALUE BELOW IS APPLE'S OWN, MEASURED, not read off a header: the counter's "no sample" index,
// the four slots of the attachment array, the queue's 64 command buffers, and the three of the queue
// descriptor's five members a copy carries. The commands and their output are in
// facts/Metal/Descriptors16.md; a reviewer who cannot re-run them cannot settle a row here either.

// THE TWO INDICES START AT MTLCounterDontSample, which is the header's own name for "no sample here"
// and is NSUIntegerMax - NOT zero, and not a value this file chose. Measured against Apple's own fresh
// object: start and end both read 18446744073709551615, and a value the header does not give a
// default for would have been a zero that reads as "sample index 0".

// THE FOUR SLOTS. The header declares exactly two members and no superclass, and this answers
// exactly that: the two indexed members, and NOT -count, -objectAtIndex: or -setObject:atIndex:,
// which Apple's own object also does not answer (measured: all three are 0 there).
//
// FOUR IS APPLE'S NUMBER, not the header's - the header says nothing about how many slots there are -
// and it is measured, one index per process because an index past the end stops the process: Apple's
// own object answers indices 0 to 3 with an attachment descriptor and traps on 4 and above, with
// `attachmentIndex(4) must be < 4`. The same bound and the same message are Apple's for the compute,
// render and resource-state arrays, so this is one bound and not four.
//
// A READ OF AN UNWRITTEN SLOT MAKES A DESCRIPTOR and keeps it, so two reads of one index are the same
// object and a caller can set one through the array without a write first - measured, and that is
// what lets a caller fill slot 2 without having filled slot 1.
//
// A WRITE COPIES, because the header says "This always uses 'copy' semantics", and that is measured
// too: the attachment handed in and the one read back are different objects with the same values. A
// nil write RESETS the slot to a fresh descriptor, which is what "safe to set the attachment state at
// any legal index to nil, which resets that attachment descriptor state to default values" means -
// measured: the slot reads a new object whose indices are MTLCounterDontSample again.
//
// THIS ARRAY IS NOT SHARED WITH THE THREE IN MTLDescriptors14.m, and it is worth saying why rather than
// leaving a reviewer to find a near-copy. They are three classes of three other releases' objects, each
// in the file that carries its own release's API, and a C helper shared between two of those files is the
// undefined-symbol trap this repository's own contract names: a file whose exports a band's release
// already has is left out of that band, so the call is `Undefined symbols` in later bands only - a gate
// that links one band passes and only the all-band build of the canon shows it. The classes are also not
// interchangeable: each holds its own attachment type, so a shared body would still need three thin
// forwarders, which is more code than the twenty lines it replaces. AND THEY DO NOT AGREE: the three 14.0
// arrays grow to whatever index is written, where Apple's own bound is four for every one of them -
// measured on the host, one index per process, and it is in facts/Metal/Descriptors16.md. This one is
// bounded because that is what Apple's own object does; the other three are another band's rows and
// this file does not touch them.

#pragma mark - the IO command queue

// THE DESCRIPTOR AN IO QUEUE IS MADE FROM: how many command buffers may be in flight, at what
// priority, serial or concurrent, how many IO commands at once, and the allocator the queue asks for
// scratch memory. It is data, and it is carried for the same reason as every descriptor here: a
// caller can build it, fill it and read it back.
//
// THE FOUR NUMBERS ARE APPLE'S OWN, MEASURED, and three of the four are not the value a C
// enumeration would suggest: a fresh descriptor answers maxCommandBufferCount 64 - the header says
// only that it is the maximum, and says nothing about the default - priority MTLIOPriorityNormal (1,
// while the enumeration's own zero is MTLIOPriorityHigh), type MTLIOCommandQueueTypeConcurrent (0,
// which IS the enumeration's zero) and maxCommandsInFlight 0, which the header documents as "a zero
// value defaults to the system dependent maximum value".
//
// A COPY CARRIES THREE OF THE FOUR. Measured: a descriptor with 7 / low / serial / 9 set copies to
// 7 / low / serial / 0 - Apple's own -copyWithZone: does not carry maxCommandsInFlight, and this one
// does the same rather than being more faithful than the release is. The scratch buffer allocator is
// carried and read back; no release and no object of this port makes an object conforming to
// MTLIOScratchBufferAllocator, so a caller setting one is setting its own, and a fresh descriptor
// reads nil on both sides.
//
// THE QUEUE ITSELF IS NOT HERE, and that is what this row has to say. `-[MTLDevice
// newIOQueueWithDescriptor:error:]` needs an MTLIOCommandBuffer that loads a file's bytes into a
// buffer the GPU reads, on hardware with a bindless resource path; the A7 this port targets has
// neither, and the port carries no IO command buffer, no IO file handle and no scratch buffer
// allocator. So there is no object to hand this descriptor to, and MTLIOCommandQueue is absent with
