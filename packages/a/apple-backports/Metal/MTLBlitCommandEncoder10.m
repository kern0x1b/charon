// A fence on this device is a signal value the CPU holds, and the work a fence stands for was
// already issued as it was encoded: the port has no queue of commands in flight, because a command is
// a call into OpenGL ES 2.0 that has already been made. So -updateFence: records how many commands
// this encoder has encoded, which is how far the fence has been brought, and -waitForFence: waits
// for the value the fence carries.
