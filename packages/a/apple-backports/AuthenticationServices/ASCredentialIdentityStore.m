// ASCredentialIdentityStore, of iOS 12.0: where a password manager's credentials are kept.
//
// **The writing half is never run against the host, and this file says why.** On a Mac,
// `saveCredentialIdentities:`, `removeCredentialIdentities:`, `removeAllCredentialIdentities` and
// `replaceCredentialIdentitiesWithIdentities:` change the *user's* AutoFill state on that machine. A
// differential that called them to see what they return would be writing to the reviewer's passwords.
// The host side of this family is therefore read-only — only
// `getCredentialIdentityStoreStateWithCompletion:`, and only because it asks the system what it
// already holds — and the writing half's behaviour is documented from the header, not measured on the
// Mac. `tests/backports/host/authservices/values.m` greps for the four names before it runs and refuses
// to start if any of them is in the host half.
//
// **What backs it here.** A property list under `.agent-work/runs/`, beside the port's other run
// output, holding one record per identity: the service identifier's identifier and type, the user, the
// record identifier and the rank. The directory is chosen by `AS_CREDENTIAL_STORE_PATH` when it is set,
// and there is a deliberate difference from the system store: there is no daemon behind this one, and
// nothing outside the process reads it. That is what -getCredentialIdentityStoreStateWithCompletion: has
// to report, and it is why the port says the store is enabled for the application that owns it rather
// than claiming to be the system's autofill database.
