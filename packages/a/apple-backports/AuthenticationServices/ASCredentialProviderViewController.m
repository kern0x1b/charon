// ASCredentialProviderViewController, of iOS 12.0: the class a password-manager EXTENSION subclasses
// so the system can ask it for a credential.
//
// **What this class is for, and what the port does with it.** On a device the system instantiates an
// extension's provider controller, presents it, and calls the five methods below in the order the header
// documents: prepare the list of credentials for some services, prepare the interface for one identity,
// then ask for a credential without the user's interaction when the system already has a matching
// stored credential. An extension SUBCLASSES this class and overrides what it wants; the base class is
// where those calls land when it does not, and the header's contract for a base implementation is
// nothing happening.
//
// So every method here is a documented no-op default, and that is not a stub: it is the base class
// behaving as the base class behaves. An extension that overrides one gets its own behaviour; an
// extension that overrides none gets the release's own answer, which is also nothing.
//
// **What a device does that this port cannot.** The presentation itself is the system's: on a real
// device AutoFill shows this controller inside the system UI, and the identities it would offer come
// from the system's credential-identity store. The port has no such store to be presented from, and
// deliberately never touches this Mac's: the static scan and the runtime refusal in
// tests/backports/host/authservices/ are what stand between this machine's AutoFill state and a
// differential that asked the real store what it holds. The identities the port's own controller would
// offer are the ones the application's own store recorded, and facts/AuthenticationServices/records
//which that is.
