// The 15.0 optimizer surface: MLCAdamWOptimizer with its two factories and its five numbers, the three
// properties MLCOptimizer gained in 15.0, and the one factory of 14.0's MLCAdamOptimizer whose
// availability the SDK of iOS 16.4 spells "ios(15)" where every other annotation in the framework spells
// "ios(15.0)" - which is why that one method is an object of its own, MLCAdamAMSGrad15.m, and not here.
//
// Every default is measured on this host's own MLCompute and not read out of a header comment; the probe
// and its output are .agent-work/runs/probe/mlc-optimizers.m and the same file's transcript.
//
// **MLCAdamWOptimizer's five numbers are MLCAdamOptimizer's, exactly.** Measured over a descriptor with
// every field a value of its own: an Adam and an AdamW made from the same descriptor answer beta1
// 0.899999976, beta2 0.999000013, epsilon 9.99999994e-09, no AMSGrad and time step 1 - the same ten
// digits on both sides. The two optimizers differ in what an update does with them (the weight decay is
// decoupled from the gradient in AdamW and is not in Adam), and that is the engine's business, not a
// number this class holds.
