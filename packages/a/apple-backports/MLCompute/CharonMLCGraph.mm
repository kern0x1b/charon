// MLCGraph, and the arithmetic behind the layers, on ggml.
//
// The engine is ggml (packages/g/ggml, MIT, unmodified): its tensors are the port's, its graph is
// MLCGraph's node list, and each layer's descriptor is mapped onto one of its operators. Nothing here
// computes a convolution, a pooling, a matrix product or a normalization; this file says which operator
// each descriptor is, and for the few that ggml has no operator for it supplies the formula through
// ggml_map_custom1, which is that library's own elementwise operator.
//
// Every formula in here is the one the host's own MLCompute computes, measured by
// tests/backports/host/mlcompute and written down in facts/MLCompute/Engine.md. Where a formula is not
// simply the operator of the same name - the ReLUN, the clamp, the threshold, the two shrinks, the soft
// sign, the log sigmoid, the linear, the hard sigmoid, the soft plus and the GELU, all of which take
// parameters - it is the measured one, not the one the header's comment suggests, and the comments say so
// where they differ.
//
// The file is Objective-C++ because that is how a backport in this package reaches a static library
// (modules/apple/backports.lua, LIBRARIES' archives). The engine itself is C.
