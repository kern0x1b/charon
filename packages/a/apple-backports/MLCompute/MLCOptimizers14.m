// MLCOptimizer and the two optimizers of 14.0 that are its own subclasses, MLCSGDOptimizer and
// MLCAdamOptimizer, with the factories the SDK of iOS 16.4 declares for them.
//
// An optimizer is a set of numbers and nothing else: what an update does with them is the engine's
// business, and the numbers themselves are read out of the descriptor the caller hands over. Measured
// against this host's own MLCompute, .agent-work/runs/probe/mlc-optimizers.m over a descriptor whose
// every field is a value of its own (learning rate 0.125, rescale 0.25, clipping on, clip max 3.5,
// clip min -2.5, L2, scale 0.75) and over one that says nothing: every one of learningRate,
// gradientRescale, appliesGradientClipping, gradientClipMax, gradientClipMin, regularizationType and
// regularizationScale comes out of the optimizer exactly as it went into the descriptor, and
// gradientClippingType, maximumClippingNorm and customGlobalNorm are MLCGradientClippingTypeByValue, 1
// and 1 whatever the descriptor said - which is what the 14.0 descriptor factory here already answers.
//
// What each optimizer adds is its own: MLCSGDOptimizer adds a momentum scale (0.0) and a nesterov
// flag (NO), MLCAdamOptimizer adds beta1 (0.9), beta2 (0.999), epsilon (1e-8), the AMSGrad flag (NO)
// and a time step (1). All six and all five measured on the same host, over both descriptors, and the
// factories that carry numbers pass them through verbatim: a SGD made with a momentum scale of 0.625 and
// nesterov YES answers 0.625 and YES, an Adam made with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and step 7 answers those four.
