// CPLaneGuidance: guidance to give the user which lane or lanes are preferred.
//
// CPLaneGuidance.h:16-17 `API_AVAILABLE(ios(17.4))`, `NSObject <NSCopying, NSSecureCoding>`. The port
// carries it because `CPNavigationSession`'s 17.4 members need it: currentLaneGuidance's value is one
// (CPNavigationSession.h:80) and -addLaneGuidances: takes an array of them (:93).
//
// The measured answer that decides what this object does with a nil, on Apple's own CarPlay on this
// machine with no head unit attached (tests/backports/host/carplay/headunit-probe.m, section 8):
//
//   ok  a fresh lane guidance's lanes answer nil, not an empty array (measured)      nil
//   ok  a fresh lane guidance's instructionVariants answer nil, not an empty array   nil
//   ok  +supportsSecureCoding is YES (NSSecureCoding is in the header)                YES
//
// So nil in, nil out, and an empty array in, an empty array out -- two different answers, kept apart.
// This is the same honest line as the dismissal rule elsewhere in this family: a first reading of the
// header says "an array of NSString", and Apple's own object says nil, and the port follows the object.
// A defaulted @[] here would be an invented value that reads as "a guidance with no instruction", which
// is not the same thing as no guidance at all.
