// The nine 12.0 members of CPMapTemplate this port did not carry, and CPImageSet's own designated
// initialiser.
//
// Every one of them was a row saying `implemented` with nothing behind it, and the reason the gate
// could not see that is worth writing down: backports.lua's unbuilt check counts a member row as built
// when its owner class is exported, so a class answers for a member it never defined and the check says
// the row is there. Thirteen such selectors were in no source file in the package, of which
// -[CPMapTemplate startNavigationSessionForTrip:] already has a body in CarPlayNavigationSession12.m -
// the 26.2 header says that method is where a session comes to exist. The other twelve are here.
//
// What the release's own cache says about this class is what makes these members modellable here and
// not inventions: at 16.0 CPMapTemplate carries -presentNavigationAlert:animated:,
// -dismissNavigationAlertAnimated:completion:, -updateTravelEstimates:forTrip: and the rest, and its
// own -init has already made the alert, the guidance colour and the map buttons these members drive.
// The drawing they reach is the class's own: `charon_showCurrentAlert` draws the alert card over the
// release's MKMapView, `CharonMapButtons` draws the buttons, and `charon_drawTripPreviews` draws the
// previews. None of them is reimplemented here.
//
// **What each member does and does not do.** A `textConfiguration` argument is the system's font and
// scale for a car screen, and this port has no car screen to measure one on: the previews are drawn in
// this port's own label at the system's default, which is what a `UIFont` the port does not choose
// looks like. The arguments are named in the signature because the SDK declares them, and they are not
// read, because reading them would mean inventing a number. The `animated:` argument of the alert and
// the panning interface is read: it decides whether the change is animated, through this release's own
// `UIView` animation calls. The panning interface's own rule - "a maximum of two mapButtons will be
// visible" - is applied to the buttons the template holds, and the container view's `hidden` is not
// touched, because the header says nothing about the container and a caller's own `hidden` on a map
// button is what the grid button draws from.
//
// A category cannot write an ivar, so the storage for the alert, the previews, the per-trip estimates
// and the time-remaining colour is declared with the class's own ivars in CarPlayTemplatesView12.m and
// reached through the accessors declared in CharonCarPlayTemplate.h. One release per object: the 14.0
// member is in CarPlayMapTemplate14.m and CPGridButton's 26.0 `-updateImage:` is in CarPlayGrid260.m,
// with the rest of that release's own object.
