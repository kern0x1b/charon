// The 15.4 member of the navigation session: pausing with a card colour, in a 15.4 object of its own.

// CPMapTemplate.h... no: CPNavigationSession.h:44-49 is where it is declared, and it is
// `API_AVAILABLE(ios(15.4))` with its own rule: "@param turnCardColor An optional color of the pause
// card. If nil, will fallback to the guidanceBackgroundColor on CPMapTemplate. If no color is
// specified there, will default to a system-provided color." So this method is the 12.0 pause plus a
// colour, and the colour's own fallback chain is the template's -- which is why it lives in its own
// object and reaches the session's 12.0 method rather than replacing it.
#import <CarPlay/CarPlay.h>
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

// What the 12.0 object asks of the 15.4 one, so the pause reason and its description are recorded once.
