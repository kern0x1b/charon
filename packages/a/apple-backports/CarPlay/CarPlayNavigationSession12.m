// The navigation session a map template begins, and the guidance it feeds back into that template.
//
// The 26.2 header is where this comes from, and it is what makes the session an object rather than a
// wall: CPNavigationSession.h:26-27 says "A CPNavigationSession will be created for you when calling
// startNavigationSessionForTrip: on CPMapTemplate", and CPMapTemplate.h:118 says to keep a reference to
// it to perform guidance updates. The 16.0 arm64e cache agrees about who makes one: the class's only
// initialiser is the private -initWithTrip:mapTemplate:, and the private protocol
// CPNavigationSessionProviding declares -hostStartNavigationSessionForTrip:reply:. So the way in is a
// MAP TEMPLATE -- which this port carries and draws, and which is what this port has instead of a head
// unit -- and what the session carries is the program's own trip, maneuvers and estimates.
//
// What is the wall, and it is not this: a car renders the guidance on its own screen and takes the
// driver's input. There is no head unit on either fleet device, so what this object answers is the
// part a program owns, and the map template's own guidance card is where the estimates land. That is
// the same seam `facts/CarPlay/Scenes.md` names for the scenes and `facts/CarPlay/CarPlay.md` for the
// templates: the drawing is the port's, the car is the wall.
//
// -init and +new are NOT here: CPNavigationSession.h:33-34 marks both NS_UNAVAILABLE, the port's own
// header refuses an app's call the same way, and the registry carries those two rows as absent for
// exactly that reason (facts/CarPlay/Session.md).

// The session's three 17.4 properties, declared HERE and not in CharonCarPlay174.h. Two reasons, and the
// second is a measured compile error rather than a preference.
//
//   - A class EXTENSION is the file-private way to declare a property of a class whose @implementation
//     lives in this file, and it is what lets `@dynamic` below name them. Declared in a CATEGORY
//     instead, the 16.4 build fails with "property declared in category cannot be implemented in class
//     implementation" -- measured 2026-10-01 compiling this file against the build SDK.
//   - A class extension is not part of the class's public surface, which is what these three want: they
//     are 17.4 API whose accessors belong to CarPlayNavigationSession174.m's category, and this object
//     must hold their storage without holding their accessors.
//   - It is guarded by the same __has_include the header uses. The 16.4 SDK does not declare these three
//     at all (CPNavigationSession.h there stops at the 15.4 pause), so the port declares them; the 26.2
//     SDK does declare them, and redeclaring them there is "illegal redeclaration of 'readwrite' property
//     in class extension" -- measured 2026-10-01 against both SDKs. Either way the `@dynamic`
//     directives below stand, and they are what keep the getters out of this 12.0 object.
