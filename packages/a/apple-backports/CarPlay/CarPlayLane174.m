// CPLane: one lane of a lane guidance, and the angle that says which way it points.
//
// CPLane.h:22-23 `API_AVAILABLE(ios(17.4))`. The port does not carry this class today and this file is
// what carries it, because `CPNavigationSession`'s 17.4 members need it: currentLaneGuidance's value is
// a CPLaneGuidance (CPNavigationSession.h:80) and a CPLaneGuidance's `lanes` is "an array of CPLane
// objects, each describes a single lane" (CPLaneGuidance.h:20-22). The object-plus-rows rule is why the
// registry carries this class's own rows alongside the six session members that need it.
//
// WHICH RELEASE EACH HALF BELONGS TO, and this is the split the file exists for. CPLane.h is two
// releases in one header and an object may hold API of exactly one release
// (modules/apple/backports.lua's releases_in, read by `tools/release-split.lua`):
//   17.4 -- :22 the class itself, :25 -init (deprecated in 18.0), :26-27 the two -initWithAngles:...
//           initialisers are API_AVAILABLE(ios(18.0)) and are NOT here, :32 status, :33 -setStatus:,
//           :38 primaryAngle, :48 secondaryAngles, all three deprecated in 18.0.
//   18.0 -- :43 highlightedAngle, :53 angles, and the two -initWithAngles:... initialisers.
// So the 17.4 half is here and the 18.0 half is CarPlayLane18.m. What the 18.0 object needs from this
// one is storage and a Charon accessor, the same shape the session's 17.4 members use.
//
// The measured answers, from Apple's own CarPlay on this machine with no head unit attached
// (tests/backports/host/carplay/headunit-probe.m), are in facts/CarPlay/NavigationSession174.md. The one
// that matters here: a fresh CPLaneGuidance answers NIL for both of its array properties rather than an
// empty array -- "a fresh lane guidance's lanes answer nil, not an empty array (measured)  nil" -- and
// this object keeps that distinction rather than defaulting nil to @[] behind the program's back.
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
// CarPlay.h (the umbrella) does not import CPLane.h -- CPLane is not in the SDK's CarPlay.h at all, so
// the port names the header itself. Measured 2026-10-01 by compiling against the 26.2 SDK: with only
// Foundation and UIKit in scope this file failed with "unknown type name 'CPLaneStatus'; did you mean
// 'CTRunStatus'?" -- a name from CoreText, which is what an unqualified CPLaneStatus binds to when
// CarPlay's own declaration is absent. CPLaneGuidance IS reachable through the umbrella (CarPlay.h:55
// imports CPRouteInformation.h, which imports CPLaneGuidance.h), but CPLane is not on that path's
// surface, so the header is named directly rather than relied on to arrive.

// CPLane.h:26-27, :43 and :53 are `API_AVAILABLE(ios(18.0))` and are carried in an object of their own
// (CarPlayLane18.m), so this 17.4 object does not define them and the compiler says so. The suppression
// is that sentence and nothing else -- the same suppression, for the same reason, as the one at the top
// of CarPlayNavigationSession12.m for the 15.4 pause method.
