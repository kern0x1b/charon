// CPSessionConfiguration: the application's half of a CarPlay session's configuration, and the split
// between the two halves is the header's own.
//
// CPSessionConfiguration.h:25-40 is five rows in one header and they are not the same kind of thing.
// :26 gives the class, :28 the designated initialiser, :38 a readwrite weak `delegate` whose own comment
// says the system will use it "to configure the system UI" -- that is the application's half and it is
// carried here. :33 declares `limitedUserInterfaces` readonly and says only "A bitmask of what type of
// user interfaces are limited"; :36 declares `contentStyle` readonly and says "The current content style
// SUGGESTED BY THE CONNECTED CarPlay system". Those two are the connected system's, and they are
// `inert` -- the symbol loads and nothing applies it -- and `contentStyle` is 13.0 so it is an object of
// its own.
//
// Not `absent`, and that is the correction this slice makes. The 26.2 header declares both values and
// Apple's own object carries them, so an `absent` row would be a claim about Apple rather than about this
// port. The 16.0 arm64e cache says who writes them, and it says it is a connection: per class,
// CPSessionConfiguration conforms to the private protocol CARSessionObserving, carries -setContentStyle:
// and -setLimitedUserInterfaces: as its only writers of those two values, and carries the connection
// lifecycle around them -- -sessionDidConnect:, -_contentStyleUpdated:, -_limitedUIDidChange:,
// -_updateContentStyleWithScene:, -_updateLimitedUIStatus, -convertLimitableUserInterfaces:. A session is
// a connection to a head unit, and neither fleet device (iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iOS 6.1.3) has one, so
// nothing in this library writes either value and there is nothing for it to be written from.
//
// Measured on Apple's own object with no head unit attached, and on the port's, diffed label by label
// (tests/backports/host/carplay/headunit-probe.m section 5, tests/backports/host/carplay/runner.m):
//
//     ok  the designated initialiser makes a configuration               CPSessionConfiguration
//     ok  delegate answers the delegate it was given                    same object
//     ok  limitedUserInterfaces answers the mask the connected system suggests  0
//     ok  contentStyle answers the style the connected system suggests    0
//     ok  the two values have no public setter: both are readonly in the header
//     ok  what the connected system writes is the only writer: nothing here writes it  0 / 0
//
// -init and +new are NOT here: CPSessionConfiguration.h:29-30 marks both NS_UNAVAILABLE, and the
// registry carries those two rows `absent` for exactly that reason. The measurement behind that is the
// cache's own: at both 16.0 and 18.0 the class's method list contains neither `-init` nor `+new`, so the
// release declares no initialiser of its own and both are NSObject's -- which is why those rows are
// `absent` (the release carries nothing under those names) and not `ignored` (which would be the status
// for a name the release DOES carry and the port declines).
