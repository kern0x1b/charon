// The 17.4 members of the navigation session: the chronological additions and the three stored values.
//
// CPNavigationSession.h:53-58 declares -resumeTripWithUpdatedRouteInformation: `API_AVAILABLE(ios(17.4))`,
// :80 currentLaneGuidance, :87 -addManeuvers:, :93 -addLaneGuidances:, :98 currentRoadNameVariants and
// :103 maneuverState, all five `API_AVAILABLE(ios(17.4))`. These are the six rows the registry carried
// as `owed`, which is not a landing state: the release carries the names, the port could carry them,
// and nobody had written them.
//
// WHY THEY ARE NOT A WALL, measured rather than argued. A CarPlay row is often a value the connected
// car writes, and those are the ones the port carries as `inert`. These six are the opposite: they are
// the program's own values on the session the program already holds. Three measurements, all on
// Apple's own CarPlay on this machine with no head unit attached
// (tests/backports/host/carplay/headunit-probe.m, section 8):
//
//   ok  a session with nothing added answers no maneuvers at all   nil
//   ok  currentRoadNameVariants answers nil before anything is set nil
//   ok  currentLaneGuidance answers nil before anything is set     nil
//   ok  maneuverState answers 0 before anything is set             0
//        [CPNavigationSession addManeuvers:] present
//        [CPNavigationSession addLaneGuidances:] present
//        [CPNavigationSession resumeTripWithUpdatedRouteInformation:] present
//        [CPNavigationSession setCurrentRoadNameVariants:] present
//        [CPNavigationSession setManeuverState:] present
//
// A car is attached to none of that. And the release's own cache says the same from the other side,
// per class with tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over the arm64e dyld shared caches: at 16.0 the class
// carries trip, upcomingManeuvers, cancelTrip, finishTrip, pauseTripForReason:description:,
// pauseTripForReason:description:turnCardColor: and updateTravelEstimates:forManeuver: and NONE of these
// six; at 18.0 it carries all six together with the private storage accessors -setCurrentLaneGuidance:,
// -setCurrentRoadNameVariants:, -setManeuverState:, -setLaneGuidances:, -setManeuvers: and the two
// private index builders -_updateLaneGuidanceIndiciesWithStartIndex:laneGuidances: and
// -_updateManeuverIndiciesWithStartIndex:maneuvers:. The private setters are what settles the
// disposition: a value whose writer is a setter on the object is the object's own state, and a
// message to a car would have no setter here at all. `python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py
// CPLaneGuidance CPRouteInformation` answers 16.0 and 18.0 -- presence on the held ladder, which has no
// 13.x/14.x/15.x rung -- so the classes themselves are not 18.0-only even though the ladder has no rung
// that says 17.4.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE OBJECT, and this is the obstacle the port's own shape forces. Each of these members
// stores into an ivar of CPNavigationSession, and the class's @implementation is in
// CarPlayNavigationSession12.m -- a file for 12.0 that this series did not write. A category cannot
// add an ivar, so a 17.4 member written as a category here has nowhere to keep its value. The port
// already has the answer to that and uses it twice: CarPlayNavigationSession154.m is a category on the
// same class that keeps nothing of its own and reaches the storage through a Charon-prefixed accessor
// the 12.0 object declares, and CarPlayTemplatesView12.m keeps its storage on the class whose
// implementation it is. So the storage for these six lives with the class's own ivars in
// CarPlayNavigationSession12.m, behind Charon accessors, and this file carries only the 17.4 selectors.
//
// What the header says each one does, and what this follows:
//   :83-86 -addManeuvers: "add CPManeuvers in chronological order ... All maneuvers set in
//           upcomingManeuvers must be first added using this method" -- so it appends to an ordered
//           list and tells the template, because the guidance card is what shows them.
//   :90-91 -addLaneGuidances: "add CPLaneGuidances in chronological order ... added as soon as they
//           are available" -- the same accumulation for lane guidance.
//   :78    currentLaneGuidance "Must be set to nil if there is no current lane guidance.
//           CPLaneGuidances set here must first be added to the session using addLaneGuidances:" -- so
//           the value is nil until it is given and nil is a real answer, not a missing one.
//   :96-97 currentRoadNameVariants "variants of the current road name. From most to least verbose."
//   :101-102 maneuverState "the current maneuver state based on how close the maneuver is."
//   :54-57 -resumeTripWithUpdatedRouteInformation: "Resume the current trip with updated route
//           information" -- the information replaces what the session holds for the current route.
//
// The class's own rule about which release owns what is the reason this file exists separately and
// carries one release: an object may hold API of exactly one release (modules/apple/backports.lua's
// releases_in, read by `tools/release-split.lua`), so the 12.0 object stays 12.0 and the 15.4 and 17.4
// members are objects of their own.
#import <CarPlay/CarPlay.h>
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import "CharonCarPlay174.h"

// What this object asks of the session's own storage. Every name is Charon-prefixed, so it carries no
// API and stays out of the library's exports -- the same rule the 15.4 object's category follows.
