// CPMapTemplate.h:117 declares -showTripPreviews:selectedTrip:textConfiguration: as
// API_AVAILABLE(ios(14.0)), so it is not in CarPlayMapTemplate12.m: one object per release, and this is
// the object named for that one. It is the 12.0 member plus the trip to select, and the 12.0 object's
// own limit and drawing are reached rather than written twice:
//
//   -showTripPreviews:textConfiguration:               12.0, CarPlayMapTemplate12.m
//   -showTripPreviews:selectedTrip:textConfiguration:  14.0, this object
//
// A category cannot write an ivar, so the storage - the previews and the selected trip - is declared
// with the class's own ivars in CarPlayTemplatesView12.m and reached through CharonCarPlayTemplate.h.
