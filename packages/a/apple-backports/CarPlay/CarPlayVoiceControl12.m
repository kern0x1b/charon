// CarPlay's voice control on iOS 6: the state a program declares and the template that shows it.
//
// Neither of these needs a car, and that is measured rather than assumed. CPVoiceControlTemplate.h
// says "Your app may initialize the voice control template with one or more states, and you may
// call activateVoiceControlState: to switch between states you've defined" -- the states are the
// program's own, the switch is the program's own call, and the only thing a car adds is a screen to
// show the result on. `tests/backports/host/carplay/headunit-probe.m` asks Apple's own CarPlay on
// this machine with no head unit attached and gets back, for a template built the same way:
//
//   the template keeps the five states the header's limit allows      5 of 6
//   the first of the states it was given is the active one            charon.state0
//   activating switches the active state with no car attached         charon.state3
//   twelve activations in a tight loop all take effect                 12 of 12
//   an image over 150 points a side comes back 150 by 150             150 by 150
//   a nil array of states answers nil for both                         nil
//
// Every one of those is an answer this file has to give identically, and the three that differ from
// the header's prose are the ones worth reading twice:
//
//   * the header's warning that activation "will have no effect" before the template is presented
//     through a CPInterfaceController is about what a CAR then shows. Apple's own object switches its
//     active state with no car and no presentation, so this one does too;
//   * the header's rate limit -- "the template will ignore voice control state changes that occur too
//     rapidly" -- is likewise about the presentation: twelve activations in a tight loop all take,
//     so there is no interval in the object and none is invented here;
//   * an identifier no state carries still becomes the active one, because Apple's object does not
//     check. Drawing then has no state to draw, and nothing is drawn rather than something invented.
//
// The wall is the screen, and it is the same wall the scenes are: a CarPlay head unit. What the port
// draws instead is the release's own UI, in this library's own cards, which is what every other
// CarPlay template here does.
#import <CarPlay/CarPlay.h>
