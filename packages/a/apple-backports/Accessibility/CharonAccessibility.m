//  CharonAccessibility.m
//  Accessibility
//
//  The Accessibility names the port's own SDK does not have, and what each of them answers where
//  this release cannot reach the service behind it. facts/Accessibility/Accessibility.md has the
//  whole of it; the three places that matter here are:
//
//  * **A request is the system's.** +[AXRequest currentRequest] is the request the system's
//    assistive technology is currently serving, and its technology is the one serving it. This
//    release runs no assistive-technology service that holds a current request, so there is none
//    and the class is the container an application keeps its own request in.
//  * **A feature override is a service.** beginOverrideSession… is how an application asks the
//    system to turn grayscale on, or Voice Control on, for a while. The system that does it is not
//    on this release, so the manager answers nil with the error the header's own enumeration has
//    for exactly this - AXFeatureOverrideSessionErrorAppNotEntitled is the wrong one, and
//    Undefined is the one that says nothing: there is no service to be entitled to. A session that
//    cannot exist is not invented so that endOverrideSession: has something to end.
//  * **A braille table is Apple's data.** AXBrailleTable is a table of dot patterns that a
//    provider supplies, and AXBrailleTranslator maps print text onto the table it is given. The
//    table is a value this port cannot invent and the system does not ship in a form a port may
//    read, so +defaultTableForLocale: and the two sets answer empty, and a translation is only
//    what the table says: an input with no table maps to no cells.
