// CharonAVCaptureControls18.h - AVCaptureSession's controls API, transcribed from the SDK 26.2 header the
// port is written against. SDK 16.4 ships no AVCaptureControl.h and declares none of the controls API on
// AVCaptureSession (AVCaptureSession.h has no "AVCaptureControl" in it at all), so the class below and the
// category that carries the session's members are the port's own to declare; this is what this package's
// CharonAVMetrics18.h and CharonAVFoundationCaption18.h do for surface that arrived after the SDK the
// toolchain resolves.

//
// The declarations below are 26.2's own, with TWO changes, stated here rather than made silently:
//
//   * all `, visionos(<version>)` and `, watchos(<version>)` are DROPPED from the availability annotations.
//     SDK 16.4's availability.h does not know the words, and expanding one there is `error: expected ','`
//     on the line after the macro's own argument. Nothing is lost: the annotations mark platforms this
//     port does not build for.
//
//   * `API_UNAVAILABLE(macos, visionos)` on -configuresApplicationAudioSessionToMixWithOthers becomes
//     nothing, for the same reason and with the same loss, EXCEPT that the property is one the macOS
//     headers do not carry at all (measured: this host's AVCaptureSession.h:564 marks it unavailable,
//     and the runtime answers the selector while no caller may send it). The property is iOS and tvOS's,
//     and this port builds for iOS.
//
// The names the port adds beyond the SDK are listed in the delivery for rule R4.
//
// The protocol is NOT declared here: AVCaptureSessionControlsDelegate belongs to
// CharonAVFoundationProtocols.h, which is the header modules/apple/backports.lua's generated protocol
// sources import and the one tools/transcribe-protocols.py writes. A second declaration of the same
// protocol in this folder would be a duplicate definition in every translation unit that sees both.
