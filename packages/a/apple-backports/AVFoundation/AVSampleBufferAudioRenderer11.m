// AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer11.m - AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer as of 11.0, on an AudioQueue.
//
// Neither the class nor the AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering protocol it conforms to is on 6.1.3, and the
// port brings both (the protocol's own metadata comes from the source modules/apple/backports.lua writes
// for an implemented protocol row, so nothing here declares it). What this class plays with is the
// release's own AudioQueue: AudioToolbox on 6.1.3 armv7 exports 337 symbols of which 43 match
// "AudioQueue", and the media path below uses _AudioQueueNewOutput, _AudioQueueAllocateBuffer,
// _AudioQueueEnqueueBufferWithParameters, _AudioQueueFlush, _AudioQueueStart, _AudioQueueDispose,
// _AudioQueueGetCurrentTime, _AudioQueueFreeBuffer and _AudioQueueSetParameter - all of them in that
// list, read from the image's own export trie.
//
// THE TIMESTAMP IS THE WHOLE POINT, and this is the correction to the previous reading of this row:
// AudioQueueEnqueueBufferWithParameters takes an inStartTime whose mSampleTime is a queue-relative sample
// time (AudioQueue.h:1189, and its note at :1181, "the sample time is relative to the time the queue
// started"), so a buffer CAN be scheduled for the time its presentation timestamp names. The mapping is
// read off the queue itself at the instant of the enqueue: -AudioQueueGetCurrentTime answers the queue's
// sample time and the host time of that instant together, and the synchronizer's clock answers its own
// time, so the frames between two CMTimes follow from the format's sample rate and the clock's rate.
// Measured on this Mac, that is all the substrate there is to measure: CoreAudio reports the hardware not
// running ('who?' for kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices) and AudioQueueNewOutput fails, so no audio reaches an
// output here and nothing about what this plays can be listened to on this machine. What was measured
// instead is in tests/backports/host/avf-samplerender11 and in facts/AVFoundation/SampleBufferRender11.md.
//
// WHERE THE FORMAT COMES FROM. The 11.0 initialiser -initWithAudioFormatDescription:bufferCapacity: is in
// neither the 16.4 SDK this package compiles against nor this Mac's SDK, and the only selector matching
// "initWithAudioFormatDescription" in the 11.0 arm64 cache is the private _initWithAudioFormatDescription:,
// so a client on this port constructs a renderer with -init as a client does on this Mac, and the format
// arrives with the first media: CMAudioFormatDescriptionGetStreamBasicDescription on the format
// description a client hands -enqueueSampleBuffer: is what the queue is built from. Measured on the host
// for -init: status Unknown, error nil, isReadyForMoreMediaData YES, a timebase of its own, volume 1.0,
// not muted, audioTimePitchAlgorithm TimeDomain.
//
// A RATE OTHER THAN 1.0 IS HONOURED BY THE MAPPING, and that is all it is: the queue plays at the rate
// the format names, and a rate on the clock is the spacing of the start times, so the media is heard
// faster or slower with its pitch following. The port carries no time-pitch unit to hold the pitch
// (measured: 6.1.3's AVFAudio has none, and -audioTimePitchAlgorithm has no effect here for that reason),
// and the header's own wording for the rate is "play at the natural rate of the media", which is what the
// mapping is.
//
// ONE RELEASE PER OBJECT. Every symbol this file defines first appears in the 11.0 image: the class symbol
// (tools/cache-index/first-rung.py _OBJC_CLASS_$_AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer answers 11.0) and nothing
// else. Every member the 16.4 header declares for this class at another release - -currentTime,
// -setRate:time:atHostTime:, -hasSufficientMediaDataForReliablePlaybackStart,
// -delaysRateChangeUntilHasSufficientMediaData, -allowedAudioSpatializationFormats - is 12.0 or later and
// is not here; what the port answers for each of them is in the facts page.
