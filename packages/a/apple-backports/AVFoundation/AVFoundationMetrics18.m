// AVFoundation's metric event surface, one release's worth: an object may only hold API of one release,
// and which release that is was MEASURED - all sixteen classes below are first EXPORTED by the 18.0 cache
// (tools/symbol-first-release.lua over the held ladder, one `_OBJC_CLASS_$_` symbol per class, sixteen of
// them at 18.0). The two properties each variant-switch class gained at iOS 26 and the
// AVMetricMediaRendition class itself are in AVFoundationMetrics26.m, in the 26.0 band.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AVMetricEventStream
//
// This is the one class here with behaviour of its own, and it is the whole of what the header
// describes: a set of publishers, one subscriber with a queue, and the set of event classes the
// subscriber asked for. The two BOOL returns are answered by the header's own rules rather than always
// YES, so the answers are real:
//
//   -addPublisher:            NO when the argument does not conform to AVMetricEventStreamPublisher, and
//                             NO when the same publisher is already in the set. Both are checkable here
//                             and both are what "the publisher should be an AVFoundation instance
//                             conforming to AVMetricEventStreamPublisher" is for.
//   -setSubscriber:queue:     NO when the argument does not conform to AVMetricEventStreamSubscriber,
//                             and NO when a subscriber is already set. A nil queue is allowed by the
//                             header and is kept as nil.
//
// What the stream does NOT do is deliver anything, and that is a real limit rather than a missing
// piece: on this port's minimum release there is nothing that reports metrics. The publisher protocol is
// empty - it has no method at all in 26.2 - so there is no call to hand an event in, and no
// AVPlayerItem on iOS 6.1.3 raises any of the notifications these events are built from. So the stream
// keeps the subscription the caller asked for and the subscriber it was given, and the subscriber's
// -publisher:didReceiveEvent: is never called by this port. Every event class below exists, with the
// members the header declares, and is never constructed by anything here.

//
//   date        the moment the instance was created - a real measurement, taken where the object exists
//   mediaTime   CMTimeMake(0, 1), which is the zero of the timeline: this port observes no media time
//   sessionID   nil, which is what the header documents for "If not available, value is nil"
//
// +new and -init answer through NSObject, which the release has; the header marks them
// AV_INIT_UNAVAILABLE, so an application written against a newer SDK cannot reach them either, and the
// port is no more permissive than Apple about that in any row.
//
// AVMetricDownloadSummaryEvent is NOT here: the 18.0 cache exports no _OBJC_CLASS_$_AVMetricDownloadSummaryEvent,
// so nothing measures it at 18.0 and it falls back to the header's own annotation, which 26.2 writes
// `ios(18)` - without the minor - while the cache measures its sixteen siblings at 18.0. relcheck.lua then
// reads one object as holding two releases and refuses it:
//
//   AVFoundationMetrics18.m defines AVMetricDownloadSummaryEvent from iOS 18 and AVMetricContentKeyRequestEvent
//   ... from iOS 18.0; an object carries API that arrived in one release, so split it
//
// It and its six members are in AVFoundationMetrics18b.m, which is therefore the 18 band and this the 18.0
// band. The two spellings are Apple's, not the port's: 26.2 annotates this one declaration `ios(18)`.
//
// The three rendition properties each variant-switch class gained at iOS 26 - videoRendition,
// audioRendition and subtitleRendition - are NOT in this object. They are in AVFoundationMetrics26.m as a
// category on each of the two classes, because a property is API of the release it arrived in and this
// object is the 18.0 band; a category adds a selector to a class the 18.0 object defines, and
// charon_collect installs it where the class does not already answer it, which is exactly the case here.
