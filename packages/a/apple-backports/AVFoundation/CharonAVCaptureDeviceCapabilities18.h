// CharonAVCaptureDeviceCapabilities18.h - the fifteen members AVCaptureDevice, AVCaptureDeviceFormat and
// AVCaptureDeviceInput gained in iOS 18, and the three types their signatures name. SDK 16.4 declares none
// of them: its AVCaptureDevice.h has no autoVideoFrameRateEnabled, no backgroundReplacement, no
// spatialCaptureDiscomfortReasons and no systemRecommendedVideoZoomRange, and its AVCaptureInput.h has no
// multichannelAudioMode, so every typedef, forward declaration and member below is the port's own to
// declare. This is what this package's CharonAVCaptureControls18.h and CharonAVCaptureDeviceReactions17.h do
// for surface that arrived after the SDK the toolchain resolves.
//
//   iPhoneOS26.2.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/Headers/AVCaptureDevice.h:396-404,
//       :1982-1989, :2513-2531, :2647-2677, :2960-2999 (AVExposureBiasRange), :3272-3281, :3304-3313,
//       :3503-3510, :3551-3555, :3731-3748
//   iPhoneOS26.2.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/Headers/AVCaptureInput.h:353-397,
//       :400-417
//
// THE GUARD is the SDK's own knowledge of iOS 18 and not the name of a header, which is what the two
// headers above this one test for. These members live in AVCaptureDevice.h and AVCaptureInput.h in every SDK
// that declares them, so there is no header of their own to ask __has_include about, and a guard of the
// wrong shape would use this transcription beside a newer SDK's own declarations - a duplicate interface,
// measured as one by tests/backports/host/avf-globals for the controls family. MEASURED, the two SDKs this
// repository builds against: `clang -dM -E` over <Foundation/Foundation.h> defines __IPHONE_18_0 in the host
// SDK (MacOSX.sdk) and does not define it in SDK 16.4, and the host SDK's AVCaptureDevice.h declares all
// fifteen of these members.
//
// The declarations are 26.2's own with ONE change, stated here rather than made silently: every
// `visionos` word is dropped from the availability annotations. SDK 16.4's os/availability.h expands
// API_AVAILABLE and API_UNAVAILABLE over the platform names it knows and fails on any other - measured: a
// typedef carrying `API_AVAILABLE(macos(15.0), ios(18.0), macCatalyst(18.0), tvos(18.0))
// API_UNAVAILABLE(watchos, visionos)` is `error: expected ','` at the end of the line, and `API_UNAVAILABLE
// (visionos)` alone is the same error while `API_UNAVAILABLE(watchos)` alone compiles clean. So `watchos`
// is kept, Apple's own, and only `visionos` goes. Nothing is lost: it marks a platform this port does not
// build for. (This is the same drop CharonAVCaptureControls18.h makes for the same reason, measured there
// for API_AVAILABLE alone.)
//
// The names the port adds beyond the SDK are listed in the delivery for rule R4.
