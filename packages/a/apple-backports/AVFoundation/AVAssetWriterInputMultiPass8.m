// The multi-pass writer input, iOS 8: the seven members of the AVAssetWriterInputMultiPass category plus
// the class and the one property beside it, and the AVAssetExportSession sibling of the same mechanism.
// This is ONE object and it defines the API of the 8.0 release only.
//
// **The release the port runs on has none of it.** Measured over the held caches with `strings -a`, all
// nine names - performsMultiPassEncodingIfSupported, canPerformMultiplePasses, currentPassDescription,
// respondToEachPassDescriptionOnQueue:usingBlock:, markCurrentPassAsFinished, sourceTimeRanges,
// canPerformMultiplePassesOverSourceMediaData and the AVAssetWriterInputPassDescription class - answer 0
// at 4.3, 6.0, 6.1.3, 7.0 and 7.1 armv7 and are present at 8.0 armv7 (2 each, except markCurrentPassAsFinished
// at 1), with 6.1.3's own whole 113981-name selector set carrying none of them. The control of that search
// is markAsFinished, which is 4.3's own member and is found at every rung (2, 2, 2, 3, 1).
//
// **A single pass is a shape the header allows, not a compromise.** AVAssetWriterInput.h:477, on
// -currentPassDescription: "During the first pass, the request will contain a single time range from zero
// to positive infinity, indicating that all media from the source should be appended. This will also be
// true when canPerformMultiplePasses is NO, in which case only one pass will be performed." And :464, on
// -canPerformMultiplePasses being NO: "your source for media data only needs to support sequential access.
// In this case, append all of the source media once and call -markAsFinished." So an input that answers
// NO and then runs exactly the pass the header describes is answering as documented.
//
// **What Apple's own single-pass input answers, measured, is what this file answers.** Every answer below
// comes from tests/backports/host/avf-writerinput8/probe.m run against this machine's own AVFoundation,
// on a real AVAssetWriter with an H.264 input it really started: currentPassDescription is nil until
// -startWriting and then one time range zero..+infinity; -respondToEachPassDescriptionOnQueue:usingBlock:
// refuses to be called before -startWriting and refuses a second time, and otherwise invokes the block on
// the queue it was given; -markCurrentPassAsFinished makes the description nil at once and invokes the
// block ONE more time, which then sees nil, and does NOT itself call -markAsFinished; a second
// -markCurrentPassAsFinished raises; -markAsFinished on its own leaves the description nil.
// 6.1.3's AVAssetWriter has no member about passes at all, so there is nothing here that re-reads a source.
//
// **The one measured difference is canPerformMultiplePasses with the switch on, and it is not a
// convenience.** Apple's own class answers YES as soon as performsMultiPassEncodingIfSupported is YES -
// measured unattached, attached and after -startWriting - and then runs a genuine second pass, with the
// description non-nil again after -markCurrentPassAsFinished and -markAsFinished refused in between
// ("cannot be called between the invocation of markCurrentPassAsFinished and the beginning of the next
// pass"). 6.1.3's writer has no analysis pass to hand out and no re-read: the second pass here would ask
// the client to append the same media a second time to a writer that has been told it is finished, which
// is the call that raises. So this file answers NO always, the client takes the header's own NO path, and
// what the setting does is nothing - which is what the header says of a configuration that cannot benefit
// from it (AVAssetExportSession.h:433, "In these cases, setting this property to YES has no effect").
//
// **Three preconditions, and what it takes to see them.** The header's own words are what is implemented:
// "This property cannot be set after writing on the receiver's AVAssetWriter has started" (:459),
// "Before calling this method, you must ensure that the receiver is attached to an AVAssetWriter via a
// prior call to -addInput: and that -startWriting has been called on the asset writer" (:494 and :514), and
// "This method throws an exception if called more than once" (:496). None of them can be decided from the
// input: AVAssetWriter.h:225 gives a writer its inputs and nothing gives an input its writer, and
// -isReadyForMoreMediaData goes NO and comes back while media is being processed (:155), so it is not a
// latch either. The one place the start is visible is -[AVAssetWriter startWriting], which walks its own
// public -inputs; the one place a pass ends without this file being told is -markAsFinished, and the one
// place an export starts is -exportAsynchronouslyWithCompletionHandler:. So those three release methods
// are interposed on, each after the release's own implementation has run - the idiom
// UIKit/UICollectionView+Prefetching10.m uses for the same reason, and the same guard: nothing is
// installed where the release carries the API.
//
// **The guard reads a member the port does not add**, -preferredMediaChunkDuration, which is 8.0's own
// (measured: 0 at 4.3, 6.0, 6.1.3, 7.0 and 7.1, 2 at 8.0) and is `absent` in the registry, so the answer
// comes from the RELEASE's table whether or not this library's own categories are attached yet. Guarding
// on -markCurrentPassAsFinished instead would read this library's own category where the runtime attaches
// categories before +load, which is the reverse of attach.c's order on the device.
