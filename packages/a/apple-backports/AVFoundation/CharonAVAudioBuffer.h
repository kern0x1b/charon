// `AVAudioBuffer` is a real, measured trap, not a guess: the class name is already native to
// iOS 6.0/6.1.3's own AVFoundation.framework (`objc.inventory` against the real armv7 shared
// cache confirms it), but as a completely different, private, AudioQueue-era class
// (`-initWithAudioQueueBuffer:channels:`, `-packetDescriptions`, `-bytesDataSize`, no `format`,
// no `audioBufferList`) that predates and has nothing to do with the class of the same name
// AVFAudio introduced in iOS 8. The build gate's own `band()`/`duplicated()` check catches
// exactly this - "the band cannot leave a class out that nothing says is there... carry it under
// a name of Charon's own" - so this port's base class lives under `CharonAudioBuffer`, never
// under the real, already-taken `AVAudioBuffer` name.
//
// `AVAudioPCMBuffer` itself is not native to any release this port targets (confirmed absent on
// both 6.0 and 6.1.3), so it keeps its real name; only its *runtime* superclass differs from what
// Apple's own header declares. That difference is invisible to every caller: Objective-C dispatch
// is dynamic, and an application compiled against Apple's SDK header (which does say
// `AVAudioPCMBuffer : AVAudioBuffer`) only ever sends selectors - it never inspects which class
// actually implements them at link time - so every method a real caller sends still resolves
// here, correctly, regardless of the header's own claimed ancestry.
