// The iOS 10 API of the release-10 absent rows that no other object carries: -[AVPlayer
// timeControlStatus]. This file first carried -playImmediatelyAtRate: and -initWithOutputSettings: too;
// AVFoundation100.m already defined both (with automaticallyWaitsToMinimizeStalling), so they are that
// object's alone and a second category definition of the same selector is not left beside it. Every
// other row of that release stays absent, and the measurement that closes it is in
// facts/AVFoundation/AVFoundation10.md, which names the commands and their output.
//
// It is a CATEGORY method, so nm -gU over this object defines no API symbol at all and
// tools/release-split.lua checks ZERO symbols here and reports the file clean vacuously - the blind spot
// its own header documents. The class-scoped check for a category is a selector-string walk of the cache
// ladder, which is what first-rung.py answers, and the selector is 10.0.1 there while 6.1.3's AVPlayer
// does not carry it.

@implementation AVPlayer (CharonAVFoundation10)

// 10.0: the header's own three conditions, read against members the release carries.
//
//   - WaitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate holds "when the player has no item to play, i.e. when the receiver's
//     currentItem is nil" - asked first, because the header names it unconditionally.
//   - Paused is entered "upon receipt of a -pause message, an invocation of -setRate: with a value of
//     0.0", so a zero rate with an item to play is Paused.
//   - Playing against WaitingToPlayAtSpecifiedRate turns on "whether sufficient media data is available
//     to continue playback", which is what -[AVPlayerItem isPlaybackLikelyToKeepUp] answers ("sufficient
//     media data ... to continue playback", AVPlayerItem.h) - the property is a
//     `(readonly, getter=isPlaybackLikelyToKeepUp)` and the release carries that getter.
//
// The value is right on every read. No KVO notification is sent for it, because there is no state here
// to announce - the release's own -rate, -currentItem and -isPlaybackLikelyToKeepUp carry the changes, and
// a caller that observes this property observes those three instead. That limit is stated in the row's
// effect rather than papered over.
