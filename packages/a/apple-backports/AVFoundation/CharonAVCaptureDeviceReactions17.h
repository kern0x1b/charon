// CharonAVCaptureDeviceReactions17.h - the reaction-effects surface AVCaptureDevice and AVCaptureDeviceFormat
// gained in iOS 17, and the two depth-zoom members of AVCaptureDeviceFormat in iOS 17.2. SDK 16.4 declares
// none of it: its AVCaptureDevice.h has no availableReactionTypes, no canPerformReactionEffects, no
// performEffectForReaction: and its AVCaptureReactions.h does not exist, so every class, typedef and member
// below is the port's own to declare. This is what this package's CharonAVMetrics18.h and
// CharonAVCaptureControls18.h do for surface that arrived after the SDK the toolchain resolves.
//
//   iPhoneOS26.2.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/Headers/AVCaptureDevice.h:2437-2499
//   iPhoneOS26.2.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/Headers/AVCaptureReactions.h:17-22
//   iPhoneOS26.2.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/Headers/AVCaptureDeviceFormat.h
//
// The declarations are 26.2's own with ONE change, stated here rather than made silently: every
// `, visionos(<version>)` and `, watchos(<version>)` is dropped, because SDK 16.4's availability.h does not
// know those words and expanding one there is `error: expected ','` on the line after the macro's own
// argument. Nothing is lost: the annotations mark platforms this port does not build for.
//
// The names the port adds beyond the SDK are listed in the delivery for rule R4.
