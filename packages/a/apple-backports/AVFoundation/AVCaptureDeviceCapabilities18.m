// AVCaptureDeviceCapabilities18.m - the fifteen members AVCaptureDevice, AVCaptureDeviceFormat and
// AVCaptureDeviceInput gained in iOS 18, in one object, with the two refusals the header itself names.
//
// ONE OBJECT, and that is the placement rule rather than a preference: every member below is 18.0 in the
// header and in the ledger's classification of the caches, so one object holds API of one release.
// modules/apple/backports.lua's band() keeps an object in a band when that band's release exports none of
// its symbols, and this object exports none of its own - it is three categories on classes every release
// already carries - so it is kept in every band from the floor up, which is what every other capture-device
// category in this package does (AVCaptureDeviceReactions17.m says so for the same three classes). At 18.0
// and above the release's own classes would answer instead if the release exported these selectors; it does
// not, which is why they are rows at all (measured: the 18.0 arm64e cache's own Objective-C metadata carries
// none of the fifteen - facts/AVFoundation/CaptureDeviceCapabilities18.md, "What the releases carry").
//
// THE ORACLE for every answer below is one of two, and which one speaks depends on the row:
//
//   * THIS HOST'S OWN AVFoundation, against this MacBook Pro's camera and its microphone, measured by
//     tests/backports/host/avf-capabilities. That camera has Background Replacement and one microphone that
//     answers NO for wind noise removal, so several rows are the same answer on both sides and the harness
//     compares them;
//   * the SDK 26.2 header's own words for the case where the hardware does not have the feature, which is this
//     port's case: every device of this port's bands is an iPhone 4S or an iPad 2, with a camera on each
//     side and ONE microphone (measured on both, facts/AVFoundation/AVCaptureDeviceDiscovery.md, "What the
//     hardware has"), and Background Replacement, spatial video, auto video frame rate and ambisonics are
//     features of hardware Apple shipped years later.
//
// Row by row, with the line of the header that decides it. Line numbers are 26.2's own.
//
//   -isAutoVideoFrameRateEnabled   the value the last accepted -setAutoVideoFrameRateEnabled: was given,
//                                  defaulting to false: "When you change the device's active format, this
//                                  property resets to its default value of false" (:399).
//   -setAutoVideoFrameRateEnabled:
//                                  the header's own refusal, by its own rule: "Setting this property throws
//                                  an NSInvalidArgumentException if the active format's
//                                  autoVideoFrameRateSupported returns false" (:399). Every format of this
//                                  port answers NO for that (below), so every set raises here - the rule,
//                                  not a constant refusal, and the port keeps the value for a format that
//                                  supported it. Apple's own reason string, measured on this host:
//                                  "*** -[AVCaptureDALDevice setAutoVideoFrameRateEnabled:] Not supported -
//                                  use -[AVCaptureDeviceFormat autoVideoFrameRateSupported]". The tail is
//                                  Apple's character for character; the class it names is not, because
//                                  AVCaptureDALDevice is a private class of Apple's device-access layer that
//                                  this port does not have, while the setter below belongs to
//                                  AVCaptureDevice - the class the port does have.
//   +isBackgroundReplacementEnabled
//                                  NO: "A class property indicating whether the user has enabled the
//                                  Background Replacement feature for this application" (:2521). There is no
//                                  such user setting on this release - no feature to enable it for, no
//                                  Settings switch and no Control Center - so there is no choice for it to
//                                  report. The host answers 0 here as well (measured).
//   -isBackgroundReplacementActive
//                                  NO: "Indicates whether Background Replacement is currently active on a
//                                  particular AVCaptureDevice" (:2524). Nothing can start it, for the row
//                                  above. The host answers 0 here too (measured).
//   -displayVideoZoomFactorMultiplier
//                                  1.0: "In some system user interfaces ... the video zoom factor value is
//                                  displayed in a way most appropriate for visual representation and might
//                                  differ from the videoZoomFactor property value on the receiver by a fixed
//                                  ratio" (:1987). The ratio is there for a system UI to display through,
//                                  and this release has none - the header's own examples are "the macOS
//                                  Video Effects Menu" - so the factor is displayed as itself and the ratio
//                                  is the identity. (This Mac's own is 0.5, measured: its menu shows half
//                                  the capture value.)
//   -spatialCaptureDiscomfortReasons
//                                  an empty set: "the current environmental conditions are amenable to a
//                                  spatial capture that is comfortable to view" (:2673). This hardware
//                                  cannot capture spatially at all - every format answers NO for
//                                  -isSpatialVideoCaptureSupported below - so no scene is amenable. The
//                                  host answers an empty set here as well (measured).
//   Format -isAutoVideoFrameRateSupported
//                                  NO: "Indicates whether the device format supports auto video frame rate"
//                                  (:3508). The feature is the device lowering its frame rate under low
//                                  light; this hardware has no such mode. Measured on the host: 0 for all
//                                  seven of its formats.
//   Format -isBackgroundReplacementSupported
//                                  NO, "This property returns YES if the format supports Background
//                                  Replacement" (:3736), and no format of this hardware does. Measured on
//                                  the host: 1 for all seven of its formats, which is the hardware.
//   Format -isSpatialVideoCaptureSupported
//                                  NO: "Returns whether or not the format supports capturing spatial video
//                                  to a file" (:3553). Two lenses recording a depth map are what it takes;
//                                  this hardware has one lens per camera. Measured on the host: 0.
//   Format -systemRecommendedExposureBiasRange
//                                  nil: "When a recommendation is not available, this property returns nil"
//                                  (:3309). A recommendation is a system's own range for its own exposure
//                                  controls, and this release has none - AVCaptureSystemExposureBiasSlider
//                                  arrived with iOS 18 and the class is not a row this port carries. The
//                                  host answers nil here too (measured).
//   Format -systemRecommendedVideoZoomRange
//                                  nil, by the same sentence of the same paragraph (:3277), and for the same
//                                  reason: AVCaptureSystemZoomSlider is iOS 18's. Measured on the host: nil.
//   Format -videoFrameRateRangeForBackgroundReplacement
//                                  nil, the header's own answer for a format that cannot run the feature:
//                                  "If this device format does not support Background Replacement, this
//                                  property returns nil" (:3746). Measured on the host: a range, for all
//                                  seven formats, because its camera supports Background Replacement.
//   -isMultichannelAudioModeSupported:
//                                  YES for AVCaptureMultichannelAudioModeNone and NO for the other two, by
//                                  the header's own reading of what the modes are (:357-362): None is "no
//                                  multichannel audio", which is what a single microphone records, and
//                                  Stereo and first-order ambisonics are two and four microphones' worth of
//                                  audio respectively, and this device has one. Measured on this host, whose
//                                  microphone is a single one as well: 1, 0, 0 - the port and the host agree
//                                  on all three modes.
//   -multichannelAudioMode          the value, defaulting to AVCaptureMultichannelAudioModeNone: "The default
//                                  value is AVCaptureMultichannelAudioModeNone, in which case the default
//                                  single channel audio recording is used" (:395). Measured on the host: 0.
//   -setMultichannelAudioMode:      the header's own rule, by which the value the caller may set is exactly
//                                  the set -isMultichannelAudioModeSupported: answers YES for: "The
//                                  receiver's multichannelAudioMode property can only be set to a certain
//                                  mode if this method returns YES for that mode" (:381). So None is
//                                  accepted and kept - measured on this host, which does the same - and
//                                  Stereo, first-order ambisonics, an out-of-range number and a negative one
//                                  all raise NSInvalidArgumentException with Apple's own reason, measured on
//                                  this host as "*** -[AVCaptureDeviceInput setMultichannelAudioMode:] Not
//                                  supported" (sent to an input inside a session, the host names its own
