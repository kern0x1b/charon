// iOS 11's AVFoundation on 6.1.3: two of the 32 rows at 11.0 that 6.1.3 has the substrate for, and
// the 30 that it does not. The two are one answer the release can compute rather than vocabulary it
// lacks, and both spellings of it are carried by the one category.
//
//   sourceTrackIDForFrameTiming, on the composition and on the mutable subclass, is the trackID of the
//     first layer instruction of the first instruction: AVVideoComposition.h:94 says frame timing is
//     derived from "the source asset's track with the corresponding ID", AVVideoComposition.h:650 is
//     the layer instruction's own trackID, and 6.1.3 carries both. kCMPersistentTrackID_Invalid is an
//     enumeration case (CMBase.h:347) and not a symbol, so the composition that names no track needs
//     no symbol to say so.
//
// The 30 absent rows are in three families: HLS offlining (which needs a download task this release
// does not have), depth and calibration (which needs a depth format this release does not have), and
// the members of classes that are not on this release at all. See facts/AVFoundation/AVFoundation110.md.
