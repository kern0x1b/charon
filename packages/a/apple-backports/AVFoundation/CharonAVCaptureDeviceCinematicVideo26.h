// CharonAVCaptureDeviceCinematicVideo26.h - the ten members of iOS 26's Cinematic Video capture, the string
// type one of them hands back, and the focus-mode enum the other three take. SDK 16.4 declares none of it: its AVCaptureDevice.h has no
// cinematicVideoCaptureSceneMonitoringStatuses, no CinematicVideoCaptureSupported and no
// ZoomFactorForCinematicVideo, and its AVCaptureInput.h has no cinematicVideoCaptureEnabled. So every
// declaration below is the port's own to make. This is what this package's
// CharonAVCaptureDeviceCapabilities18.h does for the same three classes a release earlier.
//
//   iPhoneOS26.2.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/Headers/AVCaptureDevice.h:1299-1328,
//       :2682-2696, :3782-3818
//   iPhoneOS26.2.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/AVFoundation.framework/Headers/AVCaptureInput.h:425-439
//
// Nothing here names a type the SDK does not declare except the one string enum, which is transcribed below.
//
// THE GUARD is the SDK's own knowledge of iOS 26, for the reason CharonAVCaptureDeviceCapabilities18.h gives:
// these members live in AVCaptureDevice.h and AVCaptureInput.h in every SDK that declares them, so there is no
// header of their own to ask __has_include about. MEASURED: `clang -dM -E` over <Foundation/Foundation.h>
// __IPHONE_26_0 is defined by the host SDK and absent from SDK 16.4.
//
// The declarations are 26.2's own with ONE change, stated here rather than made silently: every `visionos` word
// is dropped from the availability annotations, because SDK 16.4's os/availability.h fails to expand one
// (measured: `API_UNAVAILABLE(visionos)` is `error: expected ','`, `API_UNAVAILABLE(watchos)` compiles clean).
//
// The names the port adds beyond the SDK are listed in the delivery for rule R4.
