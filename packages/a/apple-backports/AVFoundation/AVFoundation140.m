// AVAssetWriter.preferredOutputSegmentInterval is the target duration of each segment the writer

// (AVAssetWriter.h:692) and kCMTimeIndefinite leaving it to -flushSegment. 6.1.3's AVAssetWriter
// carries -movieFragmentInterval and -setMovieFragmentInterval: among its 35 own instance methods, and
// that is the release's only segment-duration member: -startSessionAtSourceTime: and
// -endSessionAtSourceTime: are the session boundaries and the interval is what divides them. So a
// positive numeric value is applied there, which is the whole of what this release can do with it, and
// a composition that has set none answers kCMTimeInvalid, which first-rung places at 4.0.
