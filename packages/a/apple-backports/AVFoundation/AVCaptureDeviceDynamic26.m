// AVCaptureDeviceDynamic26.m - the thirteen members of iOS 26's dynamic aspect ratio, camera lens smudge
// detection and simulated aperture, in one object.
//
// THREE FEATURES, ONE HARDWARE QUESTION, and the header answers it for each of them in the same shape: a
// device whose sensor cannot do it reports the absent case, and this release's sensor cannot do any of the
// three.
//
//   Dynamic aspect ratio (:2718-2736). A device whose sensor can change shape mid-stream lists what it can be
//   in -supportedDynamicAspectRatios, and the two read-only members are DERIVED from that list by the header:
//   "This property is initialized to the first AVCaptureAspectRatio listed in the device's activeFormat's
//   supportedDynamicAspectRatios property. If the activeFormat's supportedDynamicAspectRatios is an empty array,
//   this property returns nil" (:2722) and "If the device's activeFormat's supportedDynamicAspectRatios is an
//   empty array, this property returns {0,0}" (:2728). So with no list there is no aspect ratio (nil) and no
//   output size ({0, 0}) - which is what the host answers too (measured), for the same reason: its camera's
//   list is empty.
//   Camera lens smudge detection (:3862-3895). The header's own defaults are the answer where the feature is
//   absent: "By default, this property returns false" for -isCameraLensSmudgeDetectionEnabled (:3871),
//   "By default, this property returns kCMTimeInvalid" for the interval (:3877), and the status enum's first
//   value is "Indicates that the detection is not enabled" (:3881) - which is the case, because
//   -setCameraLensSmudgeDetectionEnabled:detectionInterval: refuses (below) and -isCameraLensSmudgeDetectionSupported
//   is NO for every format.
//   Simulated aperture (:3894-3905 on the format, :443-452 on the input). "This property return a non-zero value
//   on devices that support the shallow depth of field effect" and "On devices that do not support changing the
//   simulated aperture value, this returns a value of 0" - so all three are 0, which is what the host answers
//   for all seven of its formats (measured). The input's own setter refuses by the header's own rule ("you may
//   only set this property if AVCaptureDevice/activeFormat/minSimulatedAperture returns a non-zero value,
//   otherwise an NSInvalidArgumentException is thrown", :450).
//
// A SIMULATED APERTURE IS PART OF CINEMATIC VIDEO, and that is why the three aperture rows are here and the
// three Cinematic Video rows are in AVCaptureDeviceCinematicVideo26.m even though 26.2 declares both halves in
// the same category: the feature renders a depth of field out of two lenses, this port has one.
//
// THE TWO REFUSALS, with Apple's own reason for each, measured on this host:
//
//   -setCameraLensSmudgeDetectionEnabled:detectionInterval:
//     *** -[AVCaptureDALDevice setCameraLensSmudgeDetectionEnabled:detectionInterval:] Not supported - use
//     -activeFormat.isCameraLensSmudgeDetectionSupported
//     The header's rule is the same, naming the same member: "AVCaptureDevice throws an NSInvalidArgumentException
//     if the AVCaptureDeviceFormat/cameraLensSmudgeDetectionSupported property on the current active format
//     returns false" (:3866). The tail after the class name is what the port raises verbatim; the class is not
//     copied, because AVCaptureDALDevice is a private class of Apple's device-access layer while these methods
//     belong to AVCaptureDevice.
//
//   -setDynamicAspectRatio:completionHandler:
//     *** -[AVCaptureDALDevice setDynamicAspectRatio:completionHandler:] Dynamic Aspect Ratio not supported by
//     this device
//     The header's rule: "This method throws an NSInvalidArgumentException if dynamicAspectRatio is not a
//     supported aspect ratio found in the device's activeFormat's supportedDynamicAspectRatios" (:2735), and
//     the list is empty, so every value is one that is not in it.
//
//   -setSimulatedAperture: (the setter of AVCaptureDeviceInput.simulatedAperture)
//     *** -[AVCaptureDeviceInput setSimulatedAperture:] Not supported - the source device must have an
//     activeFormat.minSimulatedAperture greater than 0.
//     Apple's own text again, and here the class in the prefix IS the port's own class.
//
// TWO ROWS HAVE NO HOST VALUE, and both are recorded as such rather than compared:
//   -[AVCaptureDeviceFormat isCameraLensSmudgeDetectionSupported] raises on this host for EVERY one of its
//   seven formats (measured: NSInvalidArgumentException, "-[__NSCFType mediaType]: unrecognized selector sent
//   to instance", raised inside Apple's own -figCaptureSourceVideoFormat), so there is no host value to put
//   in a table; and AVCaptureAspectRatio's five constants are code+lift rows of their own and are not carried,
//   which is why the supported-ratios array this port answers is empty and nothing a caller can name is in it.
#import "CharonAVCaptureDeviceDynamic26.h"
#import <objc/runtime.h>

// The aperture the caller last set on an input. The value is only ever the format's own 0 here - every other
// value is refused - and an associated object is the only place a category can keep one: the class belongs to
// the release and a category cannot add an ivar to it.
