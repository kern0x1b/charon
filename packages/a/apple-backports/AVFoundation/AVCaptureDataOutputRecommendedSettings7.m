// The two asset-writer recommendations iOS 7.0 added to the capture data outputs, ONE object, the API of
// the 7.0 release only.
//
// **What the release the port runs on has to offer.** 6.1.3's AVCaptureAudioDataOutput carries 13 own
// instance methods and none of them recommends anything - they are -sampleBufferDelegate and its queue,
// -sampleBufferCallbackQueue, -connectionMediaTypes and the session hooks - and
// -recommendedAudioSettingsForAssetWriterWithOutputFileType: is 7.0's. 6.1.3's AVCaptureVideoDataOutput
// carries 26 own instance methods among which are -videoSettings/-setVideoSettings:,
// -availableVideoCodecTypes (5.0's, and this file uses it), -availableVideoCVPixelFormatTypes and
// -vettedVideoSettingsForSettingsDictionary: - the settings are all reachable there, one member at a time.
// What 7.0 added is the single call that picks them, and both methods are declared `nullable`.
//
// **The values come from the live capture, not from this file.** Both headers say so: "Note that the
// dictionary of settings is dependent on the current configuration of the receiver's AVCaptureSession and
// its inputs. The settings dictionary may change if the session's configuration changes. As such, you should
// configure your session first, then query the recommended audio settings" (AVCaptureAudioDataOutput.h:115)
// and the same sentence for video (AVCaptureVideoDataOutput.h:109). So both dictionaries here are built
// out of what the receiver's own connections carry at the moment of the call:
//
//   audio  AVSampleRateKey and AVNumberOfChannelsKey out of the AudioStreamBasicDescription of the
//          connection's own input port's format description - the release's own member, 6.0's.
//   video  AVVideoWidthKey and AVVideoHeightKey out of the dimensions of the same format description, and
//          AVVideoCodecKey out of the release's own -availableVideoCodecTypes, which is the list the
//          header ties this call to: "For QuickTime movie and ISO file types, the recommended video
//          settings will produce output comparable to that of AVCaptureMovieFileOutput" (:107), and
//          -availableVideoCodecTypes is that output's own codec list.
//
// **No bit rate, because Apple's own answer has none.** Measured on this machine's AVFoundation against a
// running session and a live input, for both file types the headers name
// (public.mpeg-4 and com.apple.quicktime-movie):
//
//   audio  AVFormatIDKey 1633772320 ('aac '), AVNumberOfChannelsKey 1, AVSampleRateKey 48000. Three keys.
//   video  AVVideoCodecKey avc1, AVVideoHeightKey 1080, AVVideoWidthKey 1920. Three keys.
//
// Neither carries AVEncoderBitRateKey or AVVideoCompressionPropertiesKey, and the left-over band this file
// replaces answered a fourth key, AVEncoderBitRateKey of `channels * 64000`, with nothing behind it. The
// encoder on the release these settings go to chooses its own rate when the dictionary does not name one,
// which is what Apple's own recommendation asks it to do; a number invented here would be a number the
// file cannot account for. The tables and the reading of them are in
// facts/AVFoundation/RecommendedSettings7.md, and the check is
// tests/backports/host/avf-recommended-settings7: one source, compiled twice, Apple's own answers and
// the port's joined key by key on the same live input.
//
// **A receiver with no session to describe answers nil**, which is what `nullable` is for and what both
// headers allow: the settings depend on the configuration of the session and its inputs, and with no
// connection there is no sample rate, no channel count and no frame size to report. The left-over
// returned nil for the video case only, on the dimensions it had read; the audio case answered a made-up
// 44100 Hz mono and a made-up bit rate for an output attached to nothing.

// The format the recommendation names for an ISO or QuickTime movie, measured: Apple's own class answers
// 'aac ' (1633772320) for both, and says so in AVCaptureAudioDataOutput.h:113, "For QuickTime movie and
// ISO files, the recommended audio settings will always produce output comparable to that of
// AVCaptureMovieFileOutput". An asset writer's audio input takes the codec the container carries, and
// AAC is the one both of these carry.
