// AVCaptureDeviceReactions17.m - the reaction-effects half of the capture-device surface iOS 17 added, and
// the two members iOS 17.2 added to AVCaptureDeviceFormat, as two objects: one release's API each.
//
// WHAT THE PORT ANSWERS, and where every answer comes from. Two oracles, and which one speaks depends on the
// row:
//
//   * this host's own AVFoundation, measured by tests/backports/host/avf-capabilities against this MacBook
//     Pro's built-in camera, which has reactions and background replacement and none of the rest;
//   * the SDK 26.2 header's own words for the case where the hardware does not have the feature, which is
//     this port's case: every device of this port's bands is an iPhone 4S or an iPad 2, and a reaction effect
//     is a camera feature of the devices Apple shipped from 2016 on.
//
// Row by row, with the header line that decides it:
//
//   -availableReactionTypes          empty set. "Returns a list of reaction types which can be passed to
//                                    performEffectForReaction" (AVCaptureDevice.h:2478) and "The list may
//                                    differ between devices" (:2481): this camera supports none, so the list
//                                    is empty. The host's camera lists all eight (measured), for the same
//                                    reason it lists them: its camera has the hardware.
//   -canPerformReactionEffects       NO. "returns YES when resources for reactions are available on the
//                                    device instance" (:2471).
//   -reactionEffectsInProgress       an empty array: nothing can start a reaction, so none is running.
//   +reactionEffectsEnabled          the DOCUMENTED rule, read out of the application: "On iOS, Reaction
//                                    Effects are enabled by default for video conferencing applications
//                                    (apps that use \"voip\" as one of their UIBackgroundModes). Non video
//                                    conferencing applications may opt in ... NSCameraReactionEffectsEnabled"
//                                    (:2448-2450). The host answers YES because its own rule is "enabled by
//                                    default for all applications" on macOS (:2447), which is a different
//                                    platform's rule and not this one's.
//   +reactionEffectGesturesEnabled   the DOCUMENTED default: "By default, gesture detection is enabled"
//                                    (:2461), which iOS 17.4 lets an application change with
//                                    NSCameraReactionEffectGesturesEnabledDefault in its Info.plist. The
//                                    host answers NO because it reflects this Mac's Control Center Gestures
//                                    setting (:2458); a release with no such setting stays at its default.
//   +systemPreferredCamera           the user's choice when there is one, and the release's own best camera
//                                    otherwise. "This property incorporates userPreferredCamera as well as other
//                                    factors, such as camera suspension and Apple cameras appearing that should
//                                    be automatically chosen ... This property always returns a device that is
//                                    present. If no camera is available nil is returned." (AVCaptureDevice.h:674).
//                                    The "other factors" this release has are the ones its own
//                                    +defaultDeviceWithMediaType: answers, and nothing invented: the devices of
//                                    this port's bands have a camera on each side and the release's answer for
//                                    AVMediaTypeVideo is "the built in camera that is primarily used for capture
//                                    and recording" (AVCaptureDevice.h:120), which is the one on the back. The
//                                    call, not a position, is what is written here, so the port cannot drift
//                                    from the release's own choice.
//   +userPreferredCamera             the camera an application chose, kept across launches, and only ever a
//                                    camera that is present. Four rules, all of the header's own:
//                                      "Setting this property allows an application to persist its user's
//                                       preferred camera across app launches and reboots. The property internally
//                                       maintains a short history, so if your user's most recent preferred camera
//                                       is not currently connected, it still reports the next best choice. This
//                                       property always returns a device that is present. If no camera is
//                                       available nil is returned. Setting the property to nil has no effect."
//                                       (AVCaptureDevice.h:661-663)
//                                    So: the most recent entry of the history that is in the device list NOW; nil
//                                    while the history is empty (measured on the host, which answers nil until an
//                                    application sets one); the release's own best camera once the history is
//                                    exhausted, which is the same "next best choice" one step further and is nil
//                                    itself when the device has no camera at all; and a nil set adds nothing, so
//                                    the choice survives it (measured on the host: after setting nil the getter
//                                    still answers the camera it was given).
//   -performEffectForReaction:        raises. "The reactionType requested must be one of those listed in
//                                    availableReactionTypes or an exception will be thrown" (:2496): the
//                                    list is empty, so every type is one that must not be passed. The
//                                    header names no exception for it, and the port raises
//                                    NSInvalidArgumentException - the name the two refusals this host's own
//                                    class raises for unsupported arguments use (measured:
//                                    "*** -[AVCaptureDALDevice setAutoVideoFrameRateEnabled:] Not supported"
//                                    and "*** -[AVCaptureDeviceInput setMultichannelAudioMode:] Not supported").
//                                    "Performing a reaction when canPerformReactionEffects is NO is
//                                    ignored" (:2496) is the other half of the same rule, and it is what a
//                                    type that IS available would get; no type is available here.
//   Format -reactionEffectsSupported NO, the same hardware answer for a format. The host's camera answers
//                                    YES for all seven of its formats (measured).
//   Format -videoFrameRateRangeForReactionEffectsInProgress
//                                    nil, the header's own nullability for a format that cannot run a
//                                    reaction. Every format of the host's camera reports
//                                    reactionEffectsSupported YES and a 15-30 AVFrameRateRange (measured),
//                                    so the NO case cannot be read off this host and the pairing comes from
//                                    the header.
//   Format -supportedVideoZoomRangesForDepthDataDelivery
//                                    an empty array, and the host's own camera answers an empty array here
//                                    too (measured): no zoom range of this camera feeds depth delivery.
//   Format -zoomFactorsOutsideOfVideoZoomRangesForDepthDeliverySupported
//                                    NO, measured NO on the host's own camera as well.
//
// THE BANDS. Both objects are categories on classes the release carries, so they export no symbol of their
// own and band() keeps them in every band from the floor up - which is what every category in this package
// does, and what the port wants: from 17.0 up, the port's answers are the ones for hardware this port's
// devices do not have, and the release's own would be the ones for hardware they do.
#import "CharonAVCaptureDeviceReactions17.h"

// THE PREFERRED-CAMERA PAIR. The choice an application made is kept in the application's own NSUserDefaults,
// under one key, as the identifiers of the devices that were set, most recent first.
//
// The key and why that store, measured rather than assumed:
//   * NSUserDefaults is the only store a program can use to keep a value "across app launches and reboots",
//     which is what the header says this property is for (:661). The release's own store is the system's and
//     is not in the application's domain - MEASURED on this host: setting +userPreferredCamera adds 0 keys to
//     the bundle's own defaults and writes nothing at all into its persistent domain. So the port keeps the
//     choice where it can, and says which key, rather than pretending to reach the system's.
//   * identifiers, not devices: an AVCaptureDevice does not outlive the process that made it, and the header's
//     promise is across launches. -uniqueID is the release's own name for a device across the process boundary.
//   * a short history, not one value, because the header keeps a short history (:662). Three entries is the
//     depth here: enough for the "most recent ... is not currently connected, it still reports the next best
//     choice" case to have a next choice to report, and bounded, which is what "short" says.
