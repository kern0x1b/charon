// AVCaptureDeviceCinematicVideo26.m - the ten members of iOS 26's Cinematic Video capture, in one object.
//
// ONE OBJECT, and one release: every member below is 26.0 in the header, and the classes are the same three
// the two slices above it in this folder carry: seven properties and three methods. It is three categories on
// classes every release carries, so it
// exports no symbol of its own and band() keeps it in every band from the floor up, which is what every other
// capture-device category in this package does.
//
// THE ORACLE, and it is this Mac's own AVFoundation against its camera and a video input, measured by
// tests/backports/host/avf-capabilities. What it answered, and what it did not:
//
//   * the host's own framework carries NO -cinematicVideoCaptureSceneMonitoringStatuses at all - measured, and
//     so that one row has no host column: the host is macOS 27 and its AVCaptureDevice does not answer the
//     selector. The port's answer for it is the header's own (an empty set, below) and the harness says so in
//     the run rather than reading a host value that is not there.
//   * every other row the host answers, and its answers are the header's own documented answers for hardware
//     that cannot do Cinematic Video: 0 for both support flags, 1.0 and 1.0 for the two zoom factors, nil for
//     the frame rate range - for all seven of its formats, measured.
//
// Cinematic Video is a feature of hardware Apple shipped years later: it renders a controllable simulated
// depth of field out of two cameras and a depth map, with focus transitions between them. A single-lens iPhone
// 4S or iPad 2 has neither the second lens nor the depth map, and the release's own capture session has no
// member for any of it - 6.1.3's AVCaptureDevice, AVCaptureDeviceFormat and AVCaptureDeviceInput own none of
// these seven selectors (tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over the 6.1.3 armv7 cache), so there is nothing for
// this object to stand on but the header's own words. Row by row:
//
//   -cinematicVideoCaptureSceneMonitoringStatuses
//                                  an empty set. The header: "The current scene monitoring statuses related to
//                                  Cinematic Video capture ... Monitor this property ... to present a UI
//                                  informing the user that they should reframe their scene for a better
//                                  Cinematic Video experience" (AVCaptureDevice.h:2690-2692). The statuses
//                                  report whether the SCENE suits the feature, and there is no feature here to
//                                  suit, so no status applies - the same shape as the spatial-capture
//                                  discomfort reasons in the 18.0 slice. The type's one constant is a 26.0
//                                  row of its own (code+lift) and is not carried, so nothing a caller can name
//                                  is ever in the set.
//   Format -isCinematicVideoCaptureSupported
//                                  NO: "This property returns true if the format supports Cinematic Video that
//                                  produces a controllable, simulated depth of field and adds beautiful focus
//                                  transitions for a cinema-grade look" (:3784). Measured on the host: 0 for
//                                  all seven of its formats.
//   Format -videoMinZoomFactorForCinematicVideo / -videoMaxZoomFactorForCinematicVideo
//                                  1.0, which is the header's own answer for a format that cannot do the
//                                  feature - "If this device format does not support Cinematic Video capture,
//                                  this property returns 1.0" (:3805, :3810) - and 1.0 is also this port's own
//                                  zoom floor: the release's minimum video zoom factor is 1 and its own
//                                  scale-and-crop limit is above it (facts/AVFoundation/Release11.md,
//                                  "The two zoom rows"). Measured on the host: 1 and 1, for all seven formats.
//   Format -videoFrameRateRangeForCinematicVideo
//                                  nil, the header's own answer for the same case: "If this device format does
//                                  not support Cinematic Video capture, this property returns nil" (:3815).
//                                  Measured on the host: nil.
//   -isCinematicVideoCaptureSupported (on the input)
//                                  whatever the device's ACTIVE FORMAT says, because the header's rule is
//                                  about the session's configuration: "This property returns true if the
//                                  session's current configuration allows Cinematic Video capture. When
//                                  switching cameras or formats, this property may change" (AVCaptureInput.h:427).
//                                  A configuration can only allow what a format supports, so the format is
//                                  what this asks - the release's own -device and -activeFormat, then this
//                                  port's format member. With no active format (which is what 6.1.3's release
//                                  answers outside a running session, measured on a device,
//                                  facts/AVFoundation/Release11.md) there is no configuration and the answer
//                                  is NO. Measured on the host: 0.
//   -isCinematicVideoCaptureEnabled
//                                  the value the caller set, false until then - "Default is false" (:433).
//   -setCinematicVideoCaptureEnabled:
//                                  "You may only set this property to true if cinematicVideoCaptureSupported is
//                                  true" (:436), so YES refuses and NO is kept. Apple's own reason, measured on
//                                  this host: "*** -[AVCaptureDeviceInput setCinematicVideoCaptureEnabled:] Not
//                                  supported - use isCinematicVideoCaptureSupported", which the port raises
//                                  unchanged - here the class in Apple's string is the one the header declares
//                                  the member on, so there is nothing to swap.
