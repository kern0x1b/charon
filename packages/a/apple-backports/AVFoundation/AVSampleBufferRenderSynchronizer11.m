// AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer11.m - AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer as of 11.0.
//
// Neither the class nor a word of this surface is on 6.1.3, and the port brings all of it. The clock it
// runs on is CoreMedia's own, built the two-step way this release exports: the plain _CMTimebaseCreate
// is 0 in 6.1.3's CoreMedia export trie (1819 exports, 62 matching "Timebase") and
// CMTimebaseCreateWithMasterClock(kCFAllocatorDefault, CMClockGetHostTimeClock(), &timebase) is two
// symbols it does export, so that is the call. Every other member below is one CMTimebase operation the
// same trie exports, and the two observers are two more it exports, the dispatch-source pair
// _CMTimebaseAddTimerDispatchSource and _CMTimebaseSetTimerDispatchSourceNextFireTime.
//
// What the host answers for each of these members was measured on this Mac through the class the macOS
// SDK declares, which carries every 11.0 name this file implements, and every answer below is that one:
// tests/backports/host/avf-samplerender11 prints the two tables side by side. The measurements that
// shaped the code, and the one it could not make, are in facts/AVFoundation/SampleBufferRender11.md.
//
// ONE RELEASE PER OBJECT. Every symbol this file defines first appears in the 11.0 image: the class
// symbol (tools/cache-index/first-rung.py _OBJC_CLASS_$_AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer answers 11.0)
// and nothing else. -currentTime is 12.0 and lives in AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer12.m;
// -setRate:time:atHostTime: is 14.5 and lives in AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer14.m.
//
// That split is why this file compiles with two warnings and no pragma: -currentTime and
// -setRate:time:atHostTime: are declared by the 16.4 header for 12.0 and 14.5, so the compiler asks where
// this object's @implementation answers them, and the answer is one object over. There is no
// #pragma clang diagnostic ignored in this file, and there is nothing else to write: the two members are
// implemented, by the objects that own their release.
