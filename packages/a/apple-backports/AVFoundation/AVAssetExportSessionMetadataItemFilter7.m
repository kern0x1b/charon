// AVAssetExportSession.metadataItemFilter, iOS 7.0: the property, and the step that applies it.
//
// **What the release the port runs on has.** 6.1.3's AVAssetExportSession carries 54 own instance methods
// and 23 own class methods, and its whole metadata surface is -metadata/-setMetadata: - the metadata
// export predates 7.0. There is no filter member, no member that names one, and no member that hands the
// export a list of items to translate: when `metadata` is nil the session copies the source asset's own
// metadata across itself. What 7.0 added is this property and the step that reads it.
//
// **The step has exactly one place to live on this release**, and the header names it: "Specifies a filter
// object to be used during export to determine which metadata items should be transferred from the source
// asset. If the value of this key is nil, no filter will be applied. This is the default. The filter will
// not be applied to metadata set with via the metadata property" (AVAssetExportSession.h:383-386). So the
// filter runs when the export starts and only when the caller has set no metadata of its own, and on this
// release the only moment the port can act is
// -[AVAssetExportSession exportAsynchronouslyWithCompletionHandler:] - 6.1.3's own member, measured
// present at 4.3 and at 6.0 as well - which every path into an export goes through.
//
// **What the port filters with is the release's own answer, not a list it built.** The port already carries
// +[AVMetadataItem metadataItemsFromArray:filteredByMetadataItemFilter:] (AVFoundation/AVMetadataItemGroups7.m,
// 7.0's, measured against Apple's own in tests/backports/host/avf-metadata), so the filtering itself is the
// release's semantics and not a re-implementation here; this object hands it the source asset's own
// common metadata and takes what comes back.
//
// **What a caller sees afterwards, measured on this Mac.** Apple's own session leaves `metadata` nil after
// the export starts and writes the filtered items into the output file instead, because there is a file to
// write them to. This release has no member that takes the items for the file, so the port puts them where
// the release will read them - on the session - and the export writes what the filter kept. A caller that
// reads `metadata` after starting an export therefore sees the filtered list here and nil on 7.0; that is
// written down in the row, and it is the price of doing the filter at the only hook the release has.
//
// Nothing here replaces a release method: the interposed implementation calls the release's own
// implementation first and then does the port's step, and it is installed only where the release does not
// carry the property - the same guard and the same idiom as
// AVFoundation/AVAssetWriterInputMultiPass8.m.
