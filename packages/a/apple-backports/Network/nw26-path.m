/*
 * The quality of the link under a path, as iOS 26 names it.
 *
 * A link quality is a measurement of what the link can carry, in four steps from "nothing measured" to
 * "good". The release this port builds for has no way to ask its own link how good it is - the
 * interface is up or it is not, and the signal strength a program can read by hand is not what this
 * measures - so every path answers "no measurement available", which is the first of the four and is
 * what the system answers where it has no measurement either.
 *
 * The declaration is the port's own: the SDK it compiles against is 16.4, which predates the call, and
 * the four values of the quality are the ones the header of a release that has them gives.
