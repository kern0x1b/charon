/*
 * Whether a path is an ultra-constrained network, as iOS 26 names it.
 *
 * An ultra-constrained path is a low-bandwidth link meant only for a device of its own - a Bluetooth
 * LE link, a LoRaWAN gateway - and the release this port builds for has none, so no path of it is one,
 * which is the answer a device without such a network gives.
 *
 * The declaration is the port's own: the SDK it compiles against is 16.4, which predates the call, and
 * the flag is the boolean the header of a release that has it says it is.
