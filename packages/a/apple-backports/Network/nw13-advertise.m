/*
 * The TXT record of an advertised service, as an object: the calls of iOS 13 that take and return
 * the record a listener publishes rather than its bytes.
 *
 * The two forms are one record: the bytes a program hands are parsed into key-value pairs, and what
 * is asked back is a copy of the record, so a program that sets the record object and a listener that
 * publishes its bytes publish the same thing. Setting one replaces the other, which is what the
 * host's own Network does, measured.
