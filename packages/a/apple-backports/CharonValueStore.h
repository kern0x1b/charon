// The value machinery every framework of this package whose classes are value objects shares: the
// property list, the dictionary and JSON a value is written as, the archiver walk, and the store each
// value keeps its properties in.
//
// It is a header of `static inline` functions and macros, not a class in a library, and that is
// deliberate: a library of this package exports only the names the registry lists, and the registry
// lists only names an SDK header declares, so a class defined in one library cannot be linked from
// another (measured on a built libFoundationBackports.dylib: six `os_log*` symbols exported, zero
// `charon_` C symbols, zero `Charon*` classes, and no registry entry beginning with `charon`). Two
// libraries that both include this header each get their own copy of the code and neither needs a
// symbol from the other. This is the same arrangement CharonSayOnce.h has for the say-once, which
// several libraries include from here.
//
// The roots a framework passes are advisory and are kept only for the record: a value is recognised by
// the store's own accessor (see CharonValueConvert), so a framework with two roots and one with
// thirty-eight are both covered by the same test and neither has to enumerate its classes.

// The property names an object has: its own class first, then each superclass, and without NSObject's
// own. This is the one place that knows what a value object is made of, and the dictionary, the JSON
// and the archiver all walk it - so a property the SDK header declares is always in the
// representation, and one it does not declare cannot be read.

// What a property's value becomes in a dictionary. Four cases, and each is the only one that keeps

//
//   - a value of the framework itself is its own dictionary, so the JSON is a tree of the same shape
//     the object graph is and nothing is flattened into a string;
//   - an NSMeasurement carries a double in a unit, and the double is the value: the unit is named by
//     the property's own declared type, which the header keeps, so a number need not repeat it;
//   - an NSDate is a point in time, and the number a JSON can carry is its time interval since the
//     reference date, which is exact and reversible;
//   - and an NSURL is its absolute string, because that is what identifies it to anything that reads
//     it.
//
// Anything else is already a JSON type. A nil property is left out of the dictionary entirely rather
// than written as null, so a reader can tell "not measured" from "measured as nothing".
