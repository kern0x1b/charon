// The two public headers the read below needs: the mach-o load commands and the two symbols that name the
// main image (the modern one is in dyld.h, the older _NSGetMachExecuteHeader in crt_externs.h). The importing
// source does not have to have carried them - the caller in UIKit did, this header does it for everyone.
#import <crt_externs.h>
#import <mach-o/dyld.h>
#import <mach-o/loader.h>

// The SDK the PROGRAM was linked against, read out of the main executable's own load command.
//
// A few of the properties this package carries are documented with a condition on it - "By default, for apps
// that are linked on or after iOS 26, this value is true" (AVCaptureSession.h:685,
// AVCaptureOutputBase.h:129) - and the condition is a property of the APPLICATION, not of this port: a band
// links against the SDK its package line names (16.4 for every band this repository builds), which is written
// into the binary as the load command's sdk field. So it is READ, never assumed, and this is the one place in
// the package that reads it.
//
// It was a file-static in UIKit/UIViewController+AutomaticPresentation.m, which is not reusable: a static in one
// object cannot be called from another, and sharing it across libraries would mean an exported symbol, which
// this package's registry does not allow (a library exports only the names an SDK header declares). Hence a
// header of static inline functions, the arrangement CharonValueStore.h and CharonSayOnce.h already use and
// for the same reason: two libraries that include this each get their own copy and neither needs a symbol from
// the other. UIViewController+AutomaticPresentation.m includes it and no longer keeps a copy of its own.
//
// Returns the sdk field as the packed version the load command stores (0x010d0000 for 13.0), or 0 where the
// main image records none - which is the value the UIKit caller's own rule was written against.
