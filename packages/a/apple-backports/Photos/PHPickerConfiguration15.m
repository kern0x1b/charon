// The two properties of iOS 15, on the class the 14.0 object implements, which is why they are a
// category: an object carries the API of one release only, and PHPickerConfiguration14.m says so
// itself with its @dynamic selection, preselectedAssetIdentifiers. The two values are held beside
// the object rather than in it, the way CAMetalLayer+Timeout11.m holds the layer's own property of
// iOS 11, because a category cannot add an ivar to a class another object implements.
//
// The copy is the part that needs saying. -[PHPickerConfiguration copyWithZone:] in the 14.0 object
// builds a new configuration and carries the three properties of iOS 14 across, so a copy made
// before this file existed would drop the two of iOS 15 - and NSCopying is a conformance the class
// declares, and -[PHPickerViewController initWithConfiguration:] copies what it is given
// (PHPickerViewController14.m:20). The copy below therefore replaces that one, and it carries every
// property the class has through its own accessors, so it stays true as the class grows. Clang's
// note that a category is implementing a method its primary class also implements is that
// arrangement, and is silenced for the same reason as in PHPickerFilter15.m.

// picker chooses one item, so there is no order to keep and nothing to deliver continuously. The
// two cases of iOS 17, Continuous and ContinuousAndOrdered, are not in the 16.4 header this package
// compiles against and are not named here; a value outside the two the header knows is kept as
// given, the way selectionLimit keeps a limit the release cannot honour.
