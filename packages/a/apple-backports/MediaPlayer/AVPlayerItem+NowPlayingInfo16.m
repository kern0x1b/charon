// AVPlayerItem.nowPlayingInfo, the 16.0 member, and nothing else.
//
// AVPlayerItem+MediaPlayerAdditions.h at SDK 26.2 is the whole contract, quoted:
//
//   @interface AVPlayerItem (MPAdditions)
//   @property (nonatomic, copy, nullable) NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *nowPlayingInfo MP_API(ios(16.0), tvos(16.0));
//   @end
//
// Readwrite, copy, nullable. A MediaPlayer category on an AVFoundation class, which is what the SDK's own
// header is - so this file is a MediaPlayer object and belongs in this directory, and the object name says
// which class it adds to.
//
// MEASURED, and this row waited two turns for it because it is the one member of the family whose owner
// class does not live in MediaPlayer's image. The per-image read (tools/mach32_methods.py over the MediaPlayer
// image at 0x31fe3000) cannot see AVPlayerItem at all, and the release's whole-cache selector list could not
// decide it either: `nowPlayingInfo` is on ONE of its 113981 distinct names, because some class somewhere
// declares it. The rung that decides a member is the whole cache, and it was run through coordination/heavy.sh
// at a load of 9.08, under the limit of 12:
//
//   CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua \
//     ~/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/dyld_shared_cache_armv7 > inventory-6.1.3.tsv
//   12549 lines: 11378 classes and 1171 protocols.
//
// From that read, all with the control that the same reader answers YES to AVPlayerItem's real selectors:
//
//   - AVPlayerItem lives in AVFoundation.framework/AVFoundation and has 237 own instance selectors and 35
//     own class selectors. `status`, `timedMetadata`, `duration` and `MPAVItem` ARE among the 237 - MPAVItem
//     is the MediaPlayer category's own method, which the per-category read already found - and
//     `nowPlayingInfo` and `setNowPlayingInfo:` are NOT. One class, one reader, a YES and a NO.
//   - exactly TWO classes in the whole 6.1.3 cache declare `nowPlayingInfo` in their own instance list:
//     MPNowPlayingInfoCenter (MediaPlayer) and MRMediaRemoteState (PrivateFrameworks/MediaRemote). Neither
//     is AVPlayerItem, and the second is a private framework no application links.
//   - a class no framework has reads absent from the same file, so the reader is not answering YES to
//     everything.
//
// THE ANSWER is Apple's own shape: a dictionary that copies on set and reads back what was set, nil when
// nothing was set - the header's own nullability. There is nothing to compute: on a release where the
// system reads this property it fills it in, and on this one there is no system reader, so the value is
// whatever the caller stored. A nowPlayingInfo that answered a synthesised dictionary from the item's
// timedMetadata would be inventing an answer Apple's own accessor does not produce on this release - the
// 16.0 contract is that the ITEM publishes what its owner set, and the owner is the caller.
//
// STORAGE, and why it is an associated object. This is a CATEGORY on a class AVFoundation owns - the
// release's AVPlayerItem is the one that carries its 237 methods, and a bare `@implementation AVPlayerItem`
// would claim all of them. A category cannot add an ivar, and redeclaring the class to add storage would
// change a class the release defines. `objc_setAssociatedObject` is public API and what this tree already
// does for the same problem (WebKit/WKWebpagePreferences13.m:39-42, SensorKit/SRSensorReader.m:120-135),
// one static address per stored property as WebKit does.
//
// One object per release, per band()'s own rule: this file holds the 16.0 member and no other AVPlayerItem
// member. MediaPlayer/MPAdTimeRange16.m is the other 16.0 object and not this one.
