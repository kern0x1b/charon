// MPMediaEntity.h at SDK 26.2 is the whole contract, quoted:
//
//   // Read-only support for Objective-C subscripting syntax with MPMediaEntity property constants.
//   - (nullable id)objectForKeyedSubscript:(id)key
//       MP_API(ios(8.0), tvos(14.0))
//       API_UNAVAILABLE(watchos, macos)
//
// The port does not invent a mapping. The key IS the MPMediaItemProperty* / MPMediaEntityProperty*
// constant - the sentence above the declaration says exactly that - and -valueForProperty: takes that
// same key and is the release's own method on MPMediaEntity:
//
//   -[MPMediaEntity valueForProperty:]        MPMediaEntity.h, ios(3.0) era, no MP_API
//
// Measured with tools/mach32_methods.py from the armv7 cache of 6.1.3 (MediaPlayer image at 0x31fe3000):
// MPMediaEntity has 18 own instance methods and 1 own class method and -valueForProperty: is among the 18.
// All 41 of the image's categories were read WITH THE CLASS EACH ONE EXTENDS, resolved through the
// category's own class pointer, and none of them extends MPMediaEntity. So nothing here can clobber the
// release's accessor and nothing in the release clobbers this one.
// -aSelectorNoFrameworkHas is absent as the control, and objectForKeyedSubscript: occurs exactly once in
// the whole 6.1.3 selector universe - on a collection class, not on MPMediaEntity, which is the trap
// facts/MediaPlayer/MPMediaItem.md:105 records for albumTrackNumber: a name in the per-cache list is
// necessary and not sufficient, and the per-class read is what decides a member.
//
// The port's answer is the release's own: a key the release has no value for answers nil, which is what
// -valueForProperty: answers and what the header's nullable says. Nothing is invented and nothing is
// defaulted, which is the whole contract of a subscript over a dictionary the entity owns.
//
// One object per release, per band()'s own rule: this file holds the 8.0 member and not the 8.0
// MPMediaItem members, which are MPMediaItem80.m's.
