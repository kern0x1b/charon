// MPChangeRepeatModeCommandEvent, the 8.0 command event, and the two properties its header declares.
//
// Carried, and for the same reason as its 9.0 and 7.1 event siblings: measured with
// tools/mach32_methods.py against the 6.1.3 cache, no class whose name holds 'CommandEvent' exists in any
// of its 236 classes and none of its 41 categories, with a nonsense selector absent as the control; and
// every one of the 236 was read and none of them declares -repeatType or -preservesRepeatMode. Those two
// names are not the same question as the class: the release's whole-cache selector list
// (~/.charon/dyld/6.1.3/selectors_armv7.txt, 113981 distinct names) has one line for 'repeatType' and none
// for 'preservesRepeatMode', so 'repeatType' belongs to some other framework's class - the trap
// facts/MediaPlayer/MPMediaItem.md:105 records for albumTrackNumber, where a name in the per-cache list is
// necessary and not sufficient and the per-class read is what decides a member. A class the release does
// not have is new code and cannot shadow anything, so there is nothing native for it to be. `absent` is
// for a member whose answer needs hardware the device lacks, and none of this family needs any.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT, because the first draft of this file claimed it and was wrong. The port already CARRIES
// the command this event belongs to - MPChangeRepeatModeCommand, introduced 8.0, ios71remotecommand.json -
// and that command's own row already says the honest thing: "a real, stateful object; never messaged by
// this port's own bridge, since no old-style repeat-mode gesture exists". The first draft here said the
// port's bridge builds every command event lazily by class, so carrying the event is what makes the
// command reach a handler. It does not, and no commit in this tree makes it: MPRemoteCommandCenter71.m's
// switch at :250-275 maps exactly TEN UIEventSubtypeRemoteControl* cases to ten commands, and this event
// is not among them.
//
// The measurement that settles it, because "the bridge does not do it" is only half a claim:
//   - Apple's entry point for handing a command an event is -[MPRemoteCommand deliverEvent:]. It is on
//     NO line of the 6.1.3 selector universe (113981 distinct names, controls prepareToPlay 1 and
//     aSelectorNoFrameworkHas 0), and there is no MPRemoteCommand class among the 236 to declare it. The
//     port does not define it either: no file under packages/a/apple-backports/ DEFINES a deliverEvent:
//     method - the name appears in this family's own prose about it and in no @implementation. The
//     port's equivalent is its own -charon_dispatch: (MPRemoteCommandCenter71.m:133), and that is
//     called from exactly one place, the switch.
//   - that switch handles ten subtypes: Play, Pause, Stop, TogglePlayPause, NextTrack, PreviousTrack,
//     BeginSeekingForward, EndSeekingForward, BeginSeekingBackward, EndSeekingBackward.
//   - and UIEvent.h in SDK 26.2 AND in 16.4 declares exactly those ten, 100 through 109, with no
//     repeat-mode, shuffle-mode, rating, playback-rate or feedback case at any availability. There is no
//     iOS version whose UIEvent can carry a repeat-mode change, so no code path anywhere can build this
//     event from a UIEvent. A repeat-mode change on this release is a setting in Settings.app and nothing
//     else, and it reaches an application through no API at all.
//
// So this class is CARRIED as what it actually is: a real, addressable MPChangeRepeatModeCommandEvent that
// a caller may construct, set -repeatType and -preservesRepeatMode on, and hand to its own handler. It is
// never messaged by this port's own bridge, for the reason measured above - which is the same honest
// posture MPChangeRepeatModeCommand's own row has carried since it landed, and the same one
// MPChangePlaybackPositionCommandEvent's row words as "the event type MPChangeRepeatModeCommand would
// deliver if this release had a scrubbing gesture to source it from". The corpus filed this row `absent`
// with the reason "the class arrived in iOS 8.0"; the truth is narrower and better: the class is here and
// works, and nothing on this device produces one.
//
// New code over the base MPRemoteCommandCenter71.m already carries. The header lines it implements,
// quoted:
//
//   @property (nonatomic, readonly) MPRepeatType repeatType;
//   @property (nonatomic, readonly) BOOL preservesRepeatMode;
//
// at MP_API(ios(8.0)). Neither carries a getter=, so the property names are the selectors, and the
// registry row is MPChangeRepeatModeCommandEvent.repeatType beside the accessor.
//
// Readwrite in the port where the header has them readonly: an event the port builds has to be able to
// carry the mode it is an event *about*, and a new class shadows nothing.
