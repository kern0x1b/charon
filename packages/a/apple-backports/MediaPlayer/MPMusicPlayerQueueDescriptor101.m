// MPMusicPlayerQueueDescriptor, MPMusicPlayerMediaItemQueueDescriptor and MPMusicPlayerStoreQueueDescriptor,
// the 10.1 API, and the per-item playback windows the header's four time setters record.
//
// MEASURED, class-scoped, with tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over the armv7 dyld shared caches of
// 6.1.3 and 4.3 (the commands are in facts/MediaPlayer/LanguageOptions.md; same two files, read once for
// the band, controls as that page records - MPNowPlayingInfoCenter PRESENT at 6.1.3 and ABSENT at 4.3):
//
//   MPMusicPlayerQueueDescriptor          ABSENT  ABSENT
//   MPMusicPlayerMediaItemQueueDescriptor ABSENT  ABSENT
//   MPMusicPlayerStoreQueueDescriptor     ABSENT  ABSENT
//
// All three are new code and cannot shadow anything, so `implemented` is available and `absent` - the
// status for a row whose answer needs a thing the device lacks - is not the word. What makes a descriptor
// worth carrying is measured separately, in MPMusicPlayerControllerQueueDescriptor101.m, which is where
// the descriptor is actually consumed.
//
// THE BASE CLASS IS ABSTRACT, and how that is enforced is a real decision rather than a convention. The
// header writes MP_INIT_UNAVAILABLE on MPMusicPlayerQueueDescriptor and gives the base NO members at
// all - no query, no IDs, nothing - so an instance of the base describes no queue and no setter could
// consume it. -init therefore refuses on the base itself. It is refused BY CLASS COMPARISON and not
// unconditionally, because BOTH concrete subclasses call [super init] on their way to being an object:
// a base -init that raised always would make both of the header's real initializers throw, which is the
// shape of that mistake and the reason it is written down here.
//
// One object per release: this file is the 10.1 API. The 11.0 pair
// (MPMusicPlayerPlayParameters, MPMusicPlayerPlayParametersQueueDescriptor) is
// MPMusicPlayerPlayParameters11.m; the 10.3 classes are MPMusicPlayerApplicationController103.m.
// release-split reads band points only, so a file mixing these releases would pass that check and still
// be wrong.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <MediaPlayer/MediaPlayer.h>

@implementation MPMusicPlayerQueueDescriptor

// MP_INIT_UNAVAILABLE, which MediaPlayerDefines.h:70-73 expands to:
//
//   #define MP_INIT_UNAVAILABLE  + (instancetype)new NS_UNAVAILABLE;  - (instancetype)init NS_UNAVAILABLE;
//
// so the header marks BOTH -init and +new unavailable on the base. That has a consequence that decides
// this whole file: a subclass's initializer cannot call [super init], because the compiler resolves that
// to the base's unavailable -init and rejects the call - measured, three errors, one per initializer here,
// each "'init' is unavailable" at the [super init] line. A base -init that merely refused at RUNTIME
// would compile and would not fix it; the unavailability is a compile-time attribute.
//
// So the base's initializer is declared in a class extension with a name of its own, and both subclasses
// call THAT. It is the one initializer the base has, it is not -init, +new and -init stay unavailable
// exactly as the header writes them, and the base's own -init below still refuses at runtime so that a
// caller reaching it through a subclass-of-subclass or a runtime call cannot construct a descriptor that
// names no queue. The name is registered as a row like any other seam the port owns - see
// registry/MediaPlayer/mpqueuedescriptor.json, which registers it as a row like any other seam the
// port owns - the rule AGENTS.md records after a reviewer's verdict on a helper with no entry, because
// the registry check asks what is built and finds nothing, and it is right.
