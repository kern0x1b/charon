// MPMediaItem's 2 10.0 members, the ones this release does not have at all.
//
// Generated from the one list in tests/backports/host/mediaplayeritem/generate.py, with the facts rows
// and the host check's table, so the three cannot drift. Do not edit by hand: change the list and run the
// generator.
//
// What 6.1.3 has, measured with tools/mach32_methods.py against the 6.1.3 cache: none of these is in any
// of the image's 236 classes' own instance lists nor in any of its 41 categories - not on MPMediaItem
// (75 own methods), not on MPMediaEntity (18), not on MPConcreteMediaItem (29), the private class a real
// item's receiver is. What the release does have is the accessor they are conveniences over:
// valueForProperty: is an own method of MPMediaEntity. So a port-created item answers from its own
// dictionary, a real item is answered by the release, and a category on the public class clobbers nothing
// because a subclass's own method wins over a category on its public ancestor.
//
// Split by introduced release, per band()'s own rule: this file holds the 2 the 26.2 header
// declares MP_API(ios(10.0)).
