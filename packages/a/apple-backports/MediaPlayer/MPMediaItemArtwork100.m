// MPMediaItemArtwork's bounds-and-handler initialiser, the one member of that class the 26.2 header
// declares and this release lacks.
//
// Measured, with tools/mach32_methods.py against the 6.1.3 cache and a negative control: the release's
// MPMediaItemArtwork has 13 own instance methods - initWithImage:, imageWithSize:,
// imageWithSize:atPlaybackTime:, imageDataWithSize:atPlaybackTime:, coverFlowImageWithSize:,
// albumImageWithSize:, albumImageDataWithSize:, hasArtworkAvailable, imageCropRect, bounds,
// _internal, set_internal:, dealloc - and initWithBoundsSize:requestHandler: is not among them. So the
// initialiser is a gap, and this file carries it.
//
// What it returns is a **port subclass**, and that is the whole design. The release declares
// imageWithSize: on MPMediaItemArtwork itself, so a category implementing it would be shadowed by the
// release's own method on the release's class and never run. A subclass is not: the initialiser is a
// category method (nothing to shadow - the release has no such method) whose implementation returns an
// instance of CharonHandlerMediaItemArtwork, whose imageWithSize: and bounds consult the handler. Real
// artwork - anything the release itself makes - is an MPConcreteMediaItemArtwork and is untouched; only
// artwork a caller made through this initialiser behaves this way, which is what the header describes.
//
// The initialiser discards self and returns the subclass instance, the pattern a class cluster's init
// uses, and it is ARC-safe: the release's own artwork instance is released and the caller's is the one
// that is kept.
//
//   - (instancetype)initWithBoundsSize:(CGSize)boundsSize requestHandler:(UIImage *(^)(CGSize size))requestHandler MP_API(ios(10.0));
//
// The block type is the header's own spelling.
