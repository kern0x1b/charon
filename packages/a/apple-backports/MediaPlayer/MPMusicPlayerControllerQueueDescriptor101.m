// The four MPMusicPlayerController queue methods that take a 10.1 queue descriptor: -setQueueWithDescriptor:,
// -appendQueueDescriptor: and -prependQueueDescriptor: (10.3), and -openToPlayQueueDescriptor:completionHandler:
// on MPSystemMusicPlayerController (11.0). The queue setting itself is the RELEASE's, called at the
// release's own spelling; this file is the translation from a descriptor to that call.
//
// MEASURED, class-scoped, with tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over the armv7 caches of 6.1.3 and 4.3
// (commands in facts/MediaPlayer/LanguageOptions.md, controls as that page records). From
// MPMusicPlayerController's own 66 instance methods at 6.1.3 - 52 at 4.3 - the queue setters that exist
// on the release:
//
//   -setQueueWithQuery:             PRESENT   PRESENT
//   -setQueueWithItemCollection:    PRESENT   PRESENT
//   -setQueueWithSeedItems:         PRESENT   PRESENT
//   -setQueueWithQuery:firstItem:   PRESENT   PRESENT
//   -setQueueWithGeniusMixPlaylist: PRESENT   (absent at 4.3)
//   -setQueueWithStoreIDs:          absent    absent
//   -setQueueWithItemIDs:           absent    absent
//
// -setQueueWithQuery: and -setQueueWithItemCollection: are BOTH declared by the SDK header as public API
// (MPMusicPlayerController.h), and both are the release's own methods, so a 10.1 media-item descriptor
// resolves onto a call the release really has, with the release's own argument order. That is what makes
// -setQueueWithDescriptor: a bridge rather than a queue this port builds and hopes for: the caller then
// hears its queue back through the release's own -nowPlayingItemAtIndex: and -nowPlayingItem.
//
// -setQueueWithQuery:firstItem: is deliberately NOT CALLED, and the reason is the sharpest measurement in
// this file. The release HAS that method - it is one of the 66 own instance methods at 6.1.3 and one of
// the 52 at 4.3 - and it is exactly the call a descriptor's startItem wants. But NO SDK HEADER DECLARES
// IT: awk over the @interface MPMusicPlayerController block of the 16.4 header lists the public queue
// setters as -setQueueWithQuery:, -setQueueWithItemCollection:, -setQueueWithStoreIDs:,
// -setQueueWithDescriptor:, -prependQueueDescriptor: and -appendQueueDescriptor:, and the two-argument
// form is not among them. So it is a private method of the framework, and calling it would be a private
// API trick where a public one exists - which this port does not do. The startItem is therefore not
// applied, and the file says so rather than reaching for the selector that would apply it.
//
// WHAT IS NOT BRIDGED, and it is most of the family. A descriptor is one of two concrete subclasses and
// only one of them has a setter on this release:
//
//   MPMusicPlayerMediaItemQueueDescriptor  ->  -setQueueWithQuery: / -setQueueWithItemCollection:  REAL, called
//   MPMusicPlayerStoreQueueDescriptor      ->  nothing                                            NO setter at either end
//
// The Store case is not a gap in this file. MPMusicPlayerController has no setter taking a Store ID in any
// spelling on 6.1.3 or 4.3, and there is nothing to resolve an ID to: MPMediaItem.playbackStoreID is on 0
// of the 113981 distinct selector names and none of the release's MPMediaItem getters is declared
// anywhere in it (facts/MediaPlayer/AbsentRows.md). Calling -setQueueWithQuery: with a query fabricated
// out of Store IDs would be a different API's answer under this method's name, which is the failure this
// port exists to avoid. So the Store descriptor is delivered unchanged and nothing pretends to have set
// a queue.
//
// One object per release, with the exception this file states rather than hides: it holds the 10.1
// setter AND the 10.3 pair AND the 11.0 method, and that is three releases. The reason is mechanical and
// is the trap in AGENTS.md under "A C function shared between backport files": a helper defined in a file
// that exports one band's API is left OUT of the bands that do not export it, so the reference is
// `Undefined symbols` in later bands only - backports-gate links one band and passes, and only the
// all-band canon build shows it. Splitting these three would put the descriptor-consuming logic and the
// two no-op methods in different objects with one calling the other. So they share one object and every
// row carries its own release in the registry, which is what band() places on. release-split reads band
// points only, so it cannot see this - the exception is stated here, in all three rows, and by each row
// naming the release its own API arrived in.
