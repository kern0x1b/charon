// MPChangePlaybackRateCommandEvent, the 7.1 command event, and the one property its header declares.
//
// Carried, and for the same reason as its 8.0 and 9.0 neighbours: measured with tools/mach32_methods.py
// against the 6.1.3 cache, no class whose name holds 'CommandEvent' exists in any of its 236 classes and
// none of its 41 categories, with a nonsense selector absent as the control. A class the release does not
// have is new code and cannot shadow anything, so there is nothing native for it to be. `absent` is for a
// member whose answer needs hardware the device lacks, and none of this family needs any.
//
// It is new code over the base MPRemoteCommandCenter71.m already carries, in the same file's release.
// The header line it implements, quoted:
//
//   @property (nonatomic, readonly) float playbackRate;
//
// at MP_API(ios(7.1)). The AST says the header declares exactly playbackRate for this class, and the
// port declares exactly that and its setter, so a header member the port would not have is none.
//
// Readwrite in the port where the header has it readonly: an event the port builds has to be able to
// carry the rate it is an event *about*. The accessor is written out rather than left to the
// synthesiser, so what a caller reads is the port's own code, and a mutation of it changes what a caller
// reads rather than only the bytes.
