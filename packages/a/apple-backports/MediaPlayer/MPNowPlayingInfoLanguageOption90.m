// MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOption and MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOptionGroup, the two 9.0 classes. Nothing
// invented: every value is stored as the caller gave it, or read out of the release's own
// AVMediaSelectionOption / AVMediaSelectionGroup.
//
// MEASURED, class-scoped, with tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over the armv7 dyld shared caches of
// 6.1.3 and 4.3. Each read carried a control in the same run: MPVolumeView and MPMediaPlaylist read
// PRESENT on both ends, and MPNowPlayingInfoCenter reads PRESENT at 6.1.3 and ABSENT at 4.3, so this
// reader discriminates instead of answering yes to everything it is shown.
//
//   name                                  6.1.3      4.3
//   MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOption          ABSENT     ABSENT
//   MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOptionGroup     ABSENT     ABSENT
//   AVMediaSelectionOption                  PRESENT    ABSENT
//   AVMediaSelectionGroup                   PRESENT    ABSENT
//
// The two classes are new code and cannot shadow anything - no release has an object of that name -
// which is what lets them be `implemented` rather than `absent`: `absent` is for a row whose answer
// needs a thing the device lacks, and nothing here needs one. What makes this more than a declaration
// is the second half of that table, read at CLASS level. The whole-cache selector list (113981 DISTINCT
// NAMES) could not have decided it: a name is on one line if ANY class anywhere declares it, so a one
// there says nothing about the owner and only a zero would mean absence.
//
//   AVMediaSelectionOption's own 24 instance methods: -locale, -mediaType, -hasMediaCharacteristic:,
//   -displaysNonForcedSubtitles, -isPlayable, -commonMetadata, -group, -dictionary, -optionID, and
//   -_title (the title accessor is PRIVATE on this release; there is no -title, which is checked below
//   rather than assumed, and is why no display name is read out of an option here).
//   AVMediaSelectionGroup's own 18: -options, -allowsEmptySelection, -_defaultOption, -asset,
//   -_isAlternateTrackGroup, -_isKeyValueGroup, -_mediaType.
//
// The two "automatic" accessors are the one place this file answers rather than stores, and the answer
// is NO. MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOption.h:56-63 documents each as "a special case that is used to
// represent the best legible/audible language option based on system preferences", each pointing at
// AVPlayerItem-selectMediaOptionAutomaticallyInMediaSelectionGroup: - so what each asks is whether the
// receiver IS that special case, an option the system inserts into a group to mean "choose for me", and
// not whether it is an ordinary option of a kind. The system's own class says the same thing: Apple's
// MediaPlayer on this machine answers NO to both accessors for every option its own designated
// initialiser can build - 34 options over both types (the type round-trips, so the grid measured
// something), thirteen languageTag values including the literal MPLangaugeOptionAutoLangaugeTag the
// header's comment names, a nil tag, nil and empty characteristics, displayName and identifier, and the
// same option installed as a group's default. Zero YES. The measurement, its control and the table are
// in tests/backports/host/mp-language-option and facts/MediaPlayer/LanguageOptions.md.
//
// This port has no system-created option either: the class is defined here, so every option that exists
// is one the application built, and none of those is the special case. An earlier version of this file
// answered from the stored TYPE on the strength of the header's comment; the measurement above is what
// refutes it, and an application that gates on these accessors is told the truth instead of being handed
// an option Apple would not call automatic.
//
// One object per release: this file is the 9.0 API of these two classes. MPChangeLanguageOptionCommandEvent90.m,
// already on main, declares an `MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOption *` property; this file is what makes
// that property's type a real class rather than a nil pointer.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#if defined(CHARON_MEDIAPLAYER_STANDIN)
// MPMediaItemStandin.h declares both classes and their full contract, and it is the ONLY place a
// stand-in build sees them declared. A second @interface for either name in this file is a duplicate
// definition and does not compile - a first draft of this file carried its own restatement of the
// contract and clang rejected it with "duplicate interface definition for class
// 'MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOption'", naming MPMediaItemStandin.h:47 as the earlier one. The stand-in
// header was already carrying a one-accessor version of this class, because MPChangeLanguageOptionCommandEvent90.m
// needs a type for its `languageOption` property; that declaration is the one, and it now carries the
// whole contract rather than a stub.
