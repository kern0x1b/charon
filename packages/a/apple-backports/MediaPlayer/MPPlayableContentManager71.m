// MPPlayableContentManager, MPContentItem, MPPlayableContentDataSource and MPPlayableContentDelegate, the
// 7.1 family, and the three methods the data source and the delegate are reached through.
//
// MEASURED, class-scoped, with tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over the armv7 dyld shared caches of
// 6.1.3 and 4.3, each read carrying its controls in the same run (facts/MediaPlayer/LanguageOptions.md
// has the commands; the two runs are the same two files):
//
//   name                             6.1.3      4.3
//   MPPlayableContentManager           ABSENT     ABSENT
//   MPContentItem                      ABSENT     ABSENT
//   MPPlayableContentDataSource        ABSENT     ABSENT
//   MPPlayableContentDelegate          ABSENT     ABSENT
//
// All four are new code and cannot shadow anything - no release has an object of that name, so there is
// nothing native for any of them to be. That is what lets them be `implemented` rather than `absent`,
// which is the status for a row whose answer needs a thing the device lacks: nothing in this family needs
// one. The protocols are read from the same 12549-line file's 1171 protocol lines, because a protocol's
// absence is a fact about the whole release and is invisible to a per-image classlist read.
//
// WHAT A CALLER GETS, and the honest limit of it. The header says the family's purpose plainly
// (MPPlayableContentManager.h:17-21): the manager "manages the interactions between a media application
// and an external media player interface", an application gives it a data source to browse content with
// and a delegate to relay playback commands to. The half this object can supply is the application's
// half - it stores the data source and the delegate, and reaches them. The other half is an EXTERNAL
// MEDIA PLAYER, which is a head unit or a car: 6.1.3 has no such endpoint, and this port does not build
// one. So the data source's -contentItemAtIndexPath: and the delegate's
// -playableContentManager:initiatePlaybackOfContentItemAtIndexPath:completionHandler: are implemented and
// REACHABLE, and nothing on this release calls them.
//
// That is the same position MPRemoteCommandCenter71.m is in, and it is worth being exact about it rather
// than calling it either a working bridge or a fake. The port's command objects are "real, addressable
// command objects that never fire" (packages/a/apple-backports/xmake.lua:120) because the release's own
// event mechanism above them is the old-style UIEventTypeRemoteControl, which does exist. Here the
// mechanism does not exist at all: there is no MPPlayableContentManager endpoint, no head unit, and
// `CarPlay` - which every header in this family names as its replacement, MP_DEPRECATED("Use CarPlay
// framework", ios(7.1, 14.0)) - arrived in 14.0. So the honest effect of these rows is that the objects
// are real and the app's half is wired, and the system half is not there to call it.
//
// One object per release: this file is the 7.1 API. MPPlayableContentManagerContext is MP_API(ios(8.4))
// and is a file of its own - MPPlayableContentManagerContext84.m - because a file holding both would
// export 7.1 and 8.4 members in one object and band() would place it in one release.

// the item for later use." That is the whole reason this class is not a bare NSObject - it is the handle
// an external player uses to name this item later, so it is copied and held.
//
// playbackProgress is a `float` whose documented default is -1.0 and NOT 0.0, and that default is
// load-bearing: MPContentItem.h:44-45 says "0.0 = not watched/listened/viewed, 1.0 = fully
// watched/listened/viewed / Default is -1.0 (no progress indicator shown)". A synthesised float ivar is
// zero-initialised, so an object built without setting it would read 0.0 - which means "not watched" -
// where the header says the default is "no progress indicator shown". The ivar is therefore initialised
// to -1.0 explicitly, which is the one value here that a plain @synthesize would get wrong.

// with the empty string rather than leaving the ivar nil, because a nil identifier and an empty one both
// fail to name the item and only one of them is what the check and a caller can see. The empty string is
