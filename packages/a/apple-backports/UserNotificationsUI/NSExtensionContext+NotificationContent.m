// The notification content extension arrived with iOS 10, and it runs in a separate process the
// system starts; this release has no app extensions at all, so no host ever makes an NSExtensionContext
// for one. The NSExtensionContext the port carries is already recorded as inert for exactly that
// reason (registry/Foundation/ios8extensioncontext.json).
//
// The actions an extension wants offered are the extension's own, and the port keeps them and hands
// them back as they are set: an extension that set none reads an empty array rather than nil.

@implementation NSExtensionContext (UNNotificationContentExtension)

@dynamic notificationActions;

// The actions the extension wants offered. The array is the extension's own, kept and handed back as
// it is set; the system that would draw them, and the response that would come back through
// -didReceiveNotificationResponse:completionHandler:, belong to the extension host this release does
// not run.

// What is NOT here is as deliberate as what is. The four messages to a host - perform the default
// action, dismiss the content extension, and the two halves of the media state - each need something
// this release does not have: a delivered notification to act on, a presented content extension to
// dismiss, and a system that takes playback controls in a notification. A selector the port carried
// for any of them would store a state nothing can act on, which is the silent fake COORDINATION.md §2
// forbids, so they are registry entries with status absent and the port carries none of them.
