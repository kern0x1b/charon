/* The three measurement formatters of iOS 8.0 - NSLengthFormatter, NSMassFormatter and
   NSEnergyFormatter - are one machine with three sets of numbers, so what they share lives here:
   the names of a unit in the three unit styles, the figure the system converts with, which unit it
   writes a value in, the two forms it writes a stone and a person's height in, and the writing of
   the two together.

   Every number and every name in CharonUnitFormat.m is measured, not taken from the CLDR: the
   system itself is asked, through tests/backports/host/unitformat, which puts the port and the
   system in one process over the same inputs. What the release cannot be asked is its own, because
   the CLDR table its unit names come from arrived in the ICU of iOS 8.0 and every release the port
   carries is below it - measured over the whole cache ladder and written down in
   facts/Foundation/NSUnitFormat.md. What the port does ask of the release is real: the number is
   written through the release's own NSNumberFormatter, so the digits, the grouping and the decimal
   mark are the locale's, and the system of units is read from the release's own locale under
   NSLocaleMeasurementSystem, which answers "U.S.", "U.K." or "Metric". */
