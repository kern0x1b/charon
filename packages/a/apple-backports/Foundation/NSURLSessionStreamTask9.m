/* A session's stream task: a connection to a host and a port that the application reads and writes
   itself, rather than a request and a response.

   The connection is the release's own, made by `CFStreamCreatePairWithSocketToHost` exactly as
   `+[NSStream getStreamsToHostWithName:port:inputStream:outputStream:]` makes it (see
   NSStream+Socket8.m for the measurement that the release exports it), so reading, writing,
   buffering, timeouts and the native socket are the system's. What is here is the task's own
   bookkeeping: the two streams, the half-closes, the read and the write with their completion
   handlers, the delegate callbacks the header names, and the secure connection.

   The delegate callbacks are three of the four of NSURLSessionStreamDelegate, sent on the session's
   delegate queue when the session has one and on the main queue otherwise, each one only when the
   delegate answers to that selector, and never after -captureStreams: what the header says they are
   for is the read side closing, the streams being handed to the application, and the write side
   closing. The fourth, a better route, the protocol below declares and this file never sends; the
   comment at the end of -startSecureConnection says why.

   The class is an ALIAS and the task's own members are a CATEGORY, not a class implementation, and
   both are because of what the releases carry. CFNetwork's __objc_classlist has carried a class of
   this name since 8.0 with no method and no instance variable of its own -- measured over the held
   armv7 caches with objc.code_map: NSURLSessionStreamTask superclass NSURLSessionTask, 0 own
   ivars, 0 own methods at 8.0 and at 8.4.1, and no class anywhere in either release carrying
   -readDataOfMinLength:maxLength:timeout:completionHandler:, -captureStreams or
   -streamTaskWithHostName:port: -- and nothing below 8.0 carries the class at all. So there is
   nowhere to ask the release for it, and a class implementation here would be a second class of one
   name in every process on every band from 8.0 on. CHARON_ALIAS_OF defines CharonNSURLSessionStreamTask (named
   CHARON_ALIAS_CLASS(NSURLSessionStreamTask) below, which is the class of the release's name on a device and the
   release's name itself in a host differential - see charon_alias.h),
   whose superclass is the SDK's own NSURLSessionTask (which is this package's own below 7.0), and
   exports the release's name to it; the library's loader (attach.c) then hands the release's class
   every member below, so an 8.x task is an instance of CFNetwork's own class carrying them. Where
   the release has no such class the proxy is the class and its own answer is the right one. Either
   way the seven methods, the factories and the delegate protocol are this library's API, and one
   object carries them: it holds the class the release exports from 9.0 and nothing else, so
   tools/release-split.lua is clean on it.

   A category cannot add an instance variable and neither may the class behind it: attach.c lays the
   proxy out from the release's class and takes that write back when the two instance sizes differ, so
   a proxy with an instance variable of its own is never laid out after the class it stands for. The
   task's state -- the two streams, the host and the port, the half-closes, the socket's names and TLS
   values -- is therefore the one object beside this one, NSURLSessionStreamTaskState, reached through
   an associated object. It is made when it is first asked for and not in -init, because on 8.x the
   class the loader hands the members to is the release's own and -init there is the release's, which
   knows nothing of any of this. */
