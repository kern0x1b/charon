/* The 26.2 Foundation's NSMorphology.h and NSInflectionRule.h, the part of it the SDK the port builds
   against does not carry, declared here so the port can implement it.
 *
 * The 16.5 SDK declares NSMorphology and NSInflectionRule, so those two are **not** declared here -
   a redeclaration is a duplicate definition and the gate fails on it. What it does not carry is the
   iOS 17.0 set of members and the custom-pronoun and inflection-rule classes, and those are below:
 * the five grammatical properties as a **category**, because a category cannot add an ivar and their
 * storage is a side table (CharonMorphology.m), and the three classes whole, because they are
 * classes and a category cannot make one.
 *
 * Transcribed from $HOME/Git/projects/ios/charon/.agent-work/sdk-26.2/iPhoneOS26.2.sdk/System/Library/
 * Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/{NSMorphology.h,NSInflectionRule.h}, read whole - 163 and
 * 44 lines. The enums NSGrammaticalGender, NSGrammaticalPartOfSpeech, NSGrammaticalNumber,
 * NSGrammaticalCase, NSGrammaticalPronounType, NSGrammaticalPerson, NSGrammaticalDetermination and
 * NSGrammaticalDefiniteness are in the 16.5 SDK and are not repeated here. */

   portability of the API: NSGrammaticalCase runs NotSet, Nominative, Accusative, Dative, Genitive,
   Prepositional ... and NSGrammaticalDefiniteness runs NotSet, Indefinite, Definite. */
