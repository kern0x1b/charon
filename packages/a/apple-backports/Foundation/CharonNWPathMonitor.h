/*
 * The path monitor of the Foundation library, declared for the files that reach into it.
 *
 * The monitor itself is in NWPathMonitor.m with the calls that arrived in iOS 12; a call of a later
 * release is in a file of its own - modules/apple/backports.lua splits an object that exports the
 * symbols of two introductions - and needs the monitor's own state to answer, which is what this
 * header is for. The interface is declared here, the implementation is there.

   an NSObject adopting the type's protocol (nw_object.h:28) and below it is a plain C struct pointer
   with no protocol declared by any header (nw_object.h:32), so a path or a monitor is an NSObject here
   on both sides and nothing below 6.0 names a protocol that does not exist. */
