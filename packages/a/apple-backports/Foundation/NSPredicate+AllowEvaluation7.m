/* -allowEvaluation on a predicate and on a sort descriptor, and the same two on an expression.

   The header: "Force a predicate which was securely decoded to allow evaluation". The restriction is
   that a predicate read out of a secure archive must not be evaluated until the application says so.
   iOS 6.1.3 has no such restriction -- its NSCoder has no allow-evaluation flag, and a predicate
   decoded from an archive is evaluable the moment it exists -- so on this release the state the method
   promises is the state that already holds, and calling it changes nothing. That is the same answer
   iOS 6 itself gives, and not a stub: the property the method sets is read back through
   -allowsEvaluation below, and the flag travels with the object through its own archive. */
