/* The state of a progress: whether it is paused, what it says beyond its description, and the block
   to run when it resumes. Three of the five members are in NSProgress+Additions.m; they are here
   because they are one subject, the progress's own state.

   -isIndeterminate: the header says YES when the total or the completed count is less than zero, and
   NO when both are zero; the host answers YES for both zero (measured: a fresh NSProgress with no
   units, and one with 10 of 10 units answers NO), so the rule the port follows is the measured one:
   a total of zero or less, or a negative completed count. -[NSProgress pause] and -[NSProgress resume]
   are in the same file as the handlers they call, and they set and clear the flag. The resuming
   handler runs only when the progress was paused: the host does not call it when -resume is invoked
   on a progress that was never paused (measured). */
