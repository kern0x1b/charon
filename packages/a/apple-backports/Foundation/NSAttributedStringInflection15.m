/* The inflection pass of iOS 15.0: the rule a run carries is followed, and what is followed is English.

   -attributedStringByInflectingString is not a function on the text. Its own header says: "if the
   string has portions tagged with NSInflectionRuleAttributeName that have no format specifiers,
   create a new string with those portions inflected by following the rule in the attribute". So the
   rule travels in the string, the attribute names the ranges it governs, and the answer is the same
   runs with the same attributes and those ranges inflected.

   What the system's own Foundation does with the rule, measured by
   tests/backports/host/attributed15/run.sh where this member sits beside the system's in one process
   and every case compares:

     an NSInflectionRuleExplicit whose morphology says Plural, PluralFew or PluralMany is made plural,
     one that says Singular is made singular, and none of the seven numbers the SDK declares answers the
     text as it stood - measured one at a time;
     four of the fifteen parts of speech are not followed at all - Letter, Verb, Numeral and Preposition
     answer the text as it stood and the other eleven inflect - also measured one at a time;
     a range that carries no language or an English one is inflected ("en", "en-GB", "en-US" and "EN"
     all inflect), and a range carrying any other tag is left as it stood, which is what the system
     answers for de, fr, pt, it, nl, sv, da, no, fi, tr, pl, cs, ru, ar, ja and "und";
     the range has to END where a word ends, and the whole word ending there is what becomes inflected
     and not the characters the range named: "the house and the dog" tagged (4,4) and (4,3) and "the
     house" tagged (4,3) all answer the text as they stood, while "1 house" tagged (4,3) - which ends at
     the end of the string - answers "1 houses", measured;
     the word is letters and at least two of them: "child's", "house's", "house-s", "house s", "house3",
     "3", "two houses" and every word of one letter all answer the text as they stood, measured;
     a range carrying its own answer under NSInflectionAlternativeAttributeName takes that answer
     verbatim - "the mouse" with "mice" under the alternative is "the mice", measured;
     a range whose text still holds a '%' is left as it stood AND ITS TAG STAYS ON IT: the header's
     "that have no format specifiers" is the system declining to answer, and a tag it did not follow is
     still a tag;
     the tag is dropped from every run this pass answered, so a string of three runs comes back as one
     run with no attribute on it and not as three with the rule still on the middle one, and the
     neighbours that answer alike are written as one run.

   The rules. Three need no table:

     a word ending in s, x, z, ch or sh takes -es (axis -> axes, church -> churches, quiz -> quizzes);
     a word ending in a consonant and y changes that y to -ies (city -> cities), and one ending in a
     vowel and y takes -s (day -> days);
     every other word takes -s (dog -> dogs, piano -> pianos, house -> houses, sieve -> sieves).

   and six closed sets below, each one a measured English fact and each one small because the regular
   rules above cover the rest: the nouns whose two numbers are not the regular rule's, the Latin plurals
   that change back, the -f and -fe nouns that become -ves, the -o nouns that take -es, the six plurals
   whose singular keeps a final "e", and the words that end in -as, -us or -is and are their own
   singular. The regular rules get "index" and "matrix" right on their own ("indexes", "matrixes"),
   which is why neither is in a table, and they get "house" and "sieve" right by not applying to a word
   ending in e at all ("houses", "sieves"), which is why those are not in one either.

   What is NOT carried, named here and in facts/Foundation/AttributedStrings15.md with the reading: the
   system's English table is a lexicon and this one is a rule set, so a word outside these sets gets the
   regular rule's answer here where the system has its own for it - "thes" for "the" is the shape of it
   and "the" is in a table because it was measured, but a word nobody measured is a word this object may
   get wrong. One measured divergence is named as well: the system inflects a range carrying the Spanish
   tag "es" the English way and this object does not, because the tag is not English and the rules here
   are. The differential compares 309 inflection cases - every word of the tables both ways, every number
   and every part of speech the SDK declares, ten language tags, four partial ranges, the alternative,
   the format specifier and two tagged runs - and every one of them passes. */
