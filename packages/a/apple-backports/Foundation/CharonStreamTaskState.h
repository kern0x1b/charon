/* The state of one stream task: the session it belongs to, the host and the port it was made for,
   the two streams, which halves are open, whether the connection has started, whether it is secured,
   and whether the application has taken the streams over.

   It is declared here and defined in CharonStreamTaskState.m because of what
   `tools/release-split.lua` measures: NSURLSessionStreamTask9.m holds the task's own class, which a
   release exports from 9.0, and this one, which no release exports at all -- one object with two
   release groups in it. One object per group is what the tool asks for.

   It holds what used to be three instance variables of the task, because the task's members are a
   category on the release's own name (NSURLSessionStreamTask9.m says why) and a category cannot
   declare an instance variable. */
