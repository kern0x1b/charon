// The ids. OS_SIGNPOST_ID_NULL is zero and must never come back from a generate, so the counter starts
// at one and every value carries the high bit that distinguishes a generated id from a pointer's - the
// distinction signpost.h draws between the two id sources, and one the emit path below relies on.
// A generated id, and the one convention this port keeps about the two id sources. The header does
// NOT require it: os/signpost.h says a uint64_t "can be cast directly" if it uniquely identifies the
// begin/end pair, names only OS_SIGNPOST_ID_NULL and OS_SIGNPOST_ID_INVALID as reserved, and says a
// generated value "is guaranteed to be unique within the matching scope" - there is no high bit
// anywhere in it. The host does not set one either: measured twice, os_signpost_id_generate on the
// host's SensorKit answers 0x0000000000000001 with the bit clear.
//
// So the port follows the host and leaves the bit clear, and keeps the two sources apart the way the
// header's own description of them does - a generated id counts up from 1, a pointer's id IS the
// pointer, and the first two reserved values are never returned. A test reads the host's answer and
// the port's and requires them to agree; see tests/backports/host/signpost.

// So the value is NOT the pointer - the host's own round trip fails, and it is meant to - and a NULL
// pointer is not one of the two documented failures. The port therefore mangles the address the only way
// it can, which is honestly: it clears the low three bits, where an arm64 malloc never puts anything
// (the tag Apple's own allocator writes), and ORs in the port's own bit so the value cannot be mistaken
