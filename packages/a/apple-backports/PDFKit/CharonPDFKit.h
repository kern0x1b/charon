// NOT carried, and not claimed: string extraction through CGPDFScanner.  The release exports

// ---- PDFAnnotation's three colours and its font, in a category of their own ------------------------
//
// A SEPARATE CATEGORY, and a separate object, for the reason PDFAnnotationColours11.m's own header gives:
// UIColor and UIFont are UIKit's and there is no Foundation class for either on iOS, so these four are
// the only members in this header a macOS process cannot compile and the only ones the Catalyst side of
// the harness carries.  Everything else about them is as measured:
//
// All four are DECLARED READ-ONLY where PDFAnnotationUtilities.h declares them readwrite, because each
// one's setter writes back into a document and this port reads documents.  Each row says so.
//
// Every reading is keyed by the annotation's /NM rather than by its position, over
// annotation-colours.pdf, and the shape of the answer is the answer:
//
//   backgroundColor   /MK's /BG (Table 8.40's /BG, not /BC - /BC is the BORDER colour, which is the key
//                     -[PDFAnnotation border] reads), in the DEVICE colour space its COMPONENT COUNT names:
//                     one is DeviceGray, three is DeviceRGB, four is DeviceCMYK, and the components are
//                     the ARRAY'S OWN.  A /BG that is not an array is nil.
//   interiorColor     the annotation's OWN /IC, which is not an /MK key at all, in the same three Device
//                     spaces by the same component count, and nil when the annotation carries no /IC.
//                     The 26.2 header names /Circle, /Line and /Square as the subtypes that use it; the
//                     host answers it on every subtype measured, /Link and a /Tx /Widget included.
//   fontColor         the /DA's FIRST fill operand, and only a fill one - text is painted with the fill
//                     colour, so g and rg are read and G, RG and K, which set the stroke, are not, and k
//                     is not read either.  The colours are GENERIC and not device ones, and an annotation
//                     with NO /DA at all answers a generic gray at gamma 2.2 while a /DA with no readable
//                     fill answers a generic gray at gamma 1.0 - two different defaults, measured apart.
//   font              the /DA's font NAME and SIZE, read independently.  The name is used as written when
//                     the platform's own font has it, and then through an exact table of THREE
//                     abbreviations - Helv, HeBo and Cour - which is the whole of what the host resolves
//                     out of the standard fourteen's fourteen.  Anything else is Helvetica, with the size
//                     kept; the default size is 12.
//
// THE DERIVATION IS NOT IN THE OBJECT and not here either: it is in CharonPDFKitColours.h, as `static
// inline` functions over the annotation's CGPDFDictionary, which this file's four members call and which
// the harness's Catalyst side calls DIRECTLY.  That is because the platform's own PDFKit loads in that
// binary and its category would answer these four selectors - which file holds the derivation is the
// measured consequence, and its comment says so.
//
// facts/PDFKit/Annotation11.md carries the table, the fixtures that pin every clause of it, and the
// retracted readings of the version that read this fixture by index and was one annotation out of step
// from the seventh on.

// ---- PDFDestination, and the action family --------------------------------------------------
//
// Seven classes the 26.2 headers declare and neither band carries: PDFDestination, PDFAction and
// PDFActionGoTo, PDFActionNamed, PDFActionURL, PDFActionRemoteGoTo and PDFActionResetForm.  All of them
// are read out of an annotation's /A action dictionary and its /Dest, so the substrate is the release's
// own dictionary and array reader again - with ONE thing the release has no API for, which is the page a
// destination names: a destination is [pageRef /XYZ left top zoom], and there is no object-number
// accessor in this SDK, so PDFDestination11.m resolves the reference to a page DICTIONARY and matches it
// against CGPDFPageGetDictionary by identity.  That is measured to work, and it is what makes a
// destination that names the second page answer that page.

// The sentinel PDFKit's own header calls "no position is specified".  The port's value is the host's own
// (FLT_MAX, and NOT CGFLOAT_MAX - measured and recorded in registry/PDFKit/constants.json), and
// PDFKitConstants11.m exports it, so this is a declaration and not a second definition.
extern const CGFloat kPDFDestinationUnspecifiedValue;

// PDFActionNamedName, PDFActionNamed.h:15.  The twelve names the enum declares, in the header's order.
//
// The host builds a PDFActionNamed for EIGHT of them and for no other: NextPage, FirstPage, LastPage,
// GoBack, GoForward, GoToPage, Find and Print.  None, PreviousPage, ZoomIn, ZoomOut and a name the
// format does not list all answer NO ACTION AT ALL - measured one fixture per name, act-named-all.pdf -
// so the port's own -initWithName: keeps whatever it is given (the host keeps 0 and 99 too) while a
// dictionary is read through the same eight-name table.
