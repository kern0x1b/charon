// PDFPageText11.h - one page's text, in the three coordinate systems a selection needs.
//
// A PDFSelection's range is an offset into the page's -[PDFPage string], its -selectionsByLine splits that
// string at the line breaks the walk put in it, and its geometry needs the run each character was drawn
// from.  So the walk's result is not a string: it is this, and the string is one of its three answers.
//
// Nothing here is PDFKit API.  The file that implements it exports no symbol any release has, which is
// what lets a band that already carries PDFKit leave it out: see the shared-C-function trap in
// charon/AGENTS.md.  The class names are the port's own, and the port's own registry says so.
