//   two-page document answers that page, and a /D naming object 99, which is not a page, answers nil
//   (act-goto-bad-page, act-goto-badpage-xyz) while still answering the /XYZ numbers.  With no array at

//
//   the SECOND element must be a name the format lists - see charonDestinationNameIsKnown - and /XYZ
//   alone is read: element 2 is x, element 3 is y and element 4 is the zoom, each independently.  /XYZ 5 6
//   answers (5, 6) and an unspecified zoom, /XYZ 7 answers (7, unspecified), /XYZ with no numbers answers
//   an unspecified point and zoom, and /Bogus or /Zoom answers NO DESTINATION - which is why the reader
//   returns the object with nothing in it rather than a half-read one.
//
//   every OTHER fit name - /Fit, /FitB, /FitH, /FitBH, /FitBV - answers an unspecified point AND an
//   unspecified zoom, measured one fixture each, even though /FitH and /FitBH and /FitBV carry numbers
