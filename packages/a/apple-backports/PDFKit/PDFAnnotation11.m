//     not depend on the subtype.
//
//   NEITHER, and the subtype decides.  A DEFAULT border - solid, lineWidth 1 - is answered by the
//     geometry annotations /Circle, /FreeText, /Ink, /Line and /Square (noborder-circle,
//     noborder-freetext, noborder-ink, noborder-line-l, noborder-none, all answering W 1), which is
//     the set PDFAnnotation.h:165 names ("the geometry annotations (Circle, Ink, Line, Square)") with
//     /FreeText measured alongside them.  And a /Widget answers one exactly when its /MK names a
//     BORDER COLOUR the format allows: widget-bc writes four /Widget annotations whose /BC are, in
//     order, [0 0 0 1] (CMYK, four components), (a string), 0.5 (a bare number) and [0.25 0.5 0.75]
//     (RGB, three), and the host answers a border for the first and the last and nil for the middle
//     two.  With noborder-widget-bc ([0 0 1]), noborder-widget-bc-gray ([1]), noborder-widget-bc-empty
//     ([]) and mk-two ([0.25 0.5]) that is every component count the format defines - none, one, three
//     and four give a border - plus the two it does not.  The reading is the host's own: a /BC it
//     cannot make a colour of leaves no border colour, and it logs "Cannot create color from given
//     array of component count 2" while doing it.  A /BG, a BACKGROUND colour, is not a border colour:
//     noborder-widget-bg (/MK << /BG [1 0 0] >>) answers nil, and so do noborder-widget (no /MK),
//     noborder-widget-t (a /T) and noborder-widget-tm (a /Tm).  /MK is where PDF 1.7 Table 8.40 puts
//     /BC, and a widget with a border colour is a widget with a border to draw.
//
//   every other subtype answers nil with neither: /Highlight, /Link, /Popup, /Stamp, /Text,
//     /Underline and /StrikeOut (noborder-highlight, border-link, noborder-popup, noborder-stamp,
//     noborder-text, noborder-underline, noborder-strikeout).
