// PDFSelection over the page's own text.  Every answer is arithmetic over the page layout: a selection is a
// list of spans, each a page and a range in that page's string, and everything below is a way of reading,
// joining or moving that list.
//
// It is here and not in PDFPage11.m because a selection belongs to no page and reads every page, and
// because the file exports PDFKit's own PDFSelection - a file whose exports a band's release already has is
// left out of that band (charon/AGENTS.md), so nothing outside this file may call anything in it.
//
// UIColor is the header's own type for the colour member (PDFSelection.h:44, PDFKitPlatform.h) and this
// translation unit only ever STORES one: it is never created here, because a port that reads documents has
// no colour to draw with and -[PDFSelection initWithDocument:] answers nil for it - measured.

// ONE SPAN: a page, the range -rangeAtIndex:onPage: answers, and the range -string reads.
//
// The two are not always the same length, and that is measured rather than designed: for the match
// "two\nthree" on cgfixture-lines2, -selectionsByLine answers line 0 with the range {4,4} and the string
// "two" - the line's RANGE carries the newline that ends it and the line's STRING does not.  So a span
// carries both, and a line's spans are built with the break left out of the text range only.
