// Loading a Metal texture out of a Model I/O texture, which is what MetalKit's two MDL methods are.
//
// The header's words for both are the same - "create a Metal texture and load image data from the
// given MDLTexture" (MTKTextureLoader.h:268 and :332) - and the work is a real one: an MDLTexture is
// a block of texels of its own channel count and channel encoding (the Model I/O files carry that),
// and a Metal texture is a block of texels of a Metal pixel format. This maps the first onto the
// second and hands the bytes to the device.
//
// THE ROW ORDER IS THE RULE MTKTextureLoader9.m ALREADY STATES, for the same reason: a Metal
// texture's row 0 is its top row, this port's textures are OpenGL ES textures whose row 0 is the
// bottom one, and -replaceRegion: writes the bytes it is handed in the driver's own order. A
// CGImage carries no origin metadata, so that path copies the rows; an MDLTexture carries its own
// origin and exposes the two orders as two accessors, so here the rows are not copied at all:
// MTKTextureLoaderOptionOrigin picks the accessor. BottomLeft, and no option at all, read
// -texelDataWithBottomLeftOrigin; TopLeft and FlippedVertically read -texelDataWithTopLeftOrigin.
//
// WHAT IS REFUSED, and each refusal says why, is in facts/MetalKit/TextureLoaderMDL.md: the nine
// Metal pixel formats this port holds and nothing else (facts/Metal/PixelFormats.md), so a channel
// count or channel encoding with no Metal format of that shape is refused by name; an sRGB request
// is refused because the port holds no sRGB format; MTKTextureLoaderOptionCubeLayout is refused
// because MTKTextureLoader.h:90 says the option cannot be used with MDLTextures, which support cube
// textures directly; and an MDLTexture that is a cube is six faces, which this port's 2D textures
// are not.

// The Metal format of an MDLTexture's texels, or NO because this port holds no format of that shape.
// The channel count and the channel encoding are the MDLTexture's own two properties, and the nine
// formats this port holds are in facts/Metal/PixelFormats.md with the extension each one needs. A
// format whose extensions the device does not list is refused later and by the device, which is
// where facts/Metal/PixelFormats.md says that refusal belongs.
