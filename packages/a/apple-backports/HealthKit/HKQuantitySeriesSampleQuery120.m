// HKQuantitySeriesSampleQuery of iOS 12.0: the quantities of one quantity sample, delivered one at a
// time and finished with a done.
//
// One object per release: this file is of 12.0 alone.
//
// The release's own surface of this class is one initialiser. The arm64 image of 12.0 carries
// -initWithSample:quantityHandler: and nothing else of the class: by string count
// -initWithQuantityType:predicate:quantityHandler:, -includeSample and
// -orderByQuantitySampleStartDate are each 0 there, and the 26.2 header marks all three 13.0. So the
// two properties are @dynamic and emit no accessor, the selector is not in the library, and
// -respondsToSelector: answers NO rather than an accessor that would answer NO for a value the header
// types as a BOOL and a caller would read as a class of 13.0 this library has. The 13.0 initialiser is
// not carried.
//
// The sample the query is made with is found by its own identity, which is what the header of the
// initialiser points a caller at: "To query for the quantities for a specific quantity sample see:
// +[HKPredicates predicateForObjectWithUUID:]". This port asks its store by that same UUID, through the
// store's own -objectsWithUUIDs:ofType:error:, so the query reads the same SQLite file every other
// query of this library reads and there is no second way to reach it.
