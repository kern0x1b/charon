// HKWorkoutBuilder of iOS 12.0: the workout built out of samples, events and metadata added over a
// period, rather than handed to a factory whole.
//
// One object per release: this file is of 12.0 alone.
//
// The builder is a state machine the header describes and the host's own answers are the measure of:
// collection is begun with a start date, samples, events and metadata are added while it is begun, the
// period is ended with an end date, and the workout is either finished - which saves it through the
// store it was made with - or discarded. Anything added before the collection is begun, or finished
// before it is ended, is the host's own refusal, and the completion says so rather than the port
// inventing a value.
//
// -workoutActivities, -allStatistics, -addWorkoutActivity:completion: and the two
// -updateActivityWithUUID:... are of 16.0 and are @dynamic, so their selectors are not in the library
// at all and -respondsToSelector: answers NO for them, rather than an accessor that would answer nil
// and look like a version of the class this library has. -init is NS_UNAVAILABLE in the header and no
// initialiser is emitted for it.

// The store's own save, so that a finished workout reaches the same SQLite file every other object of
// this library does, and the header's promise that the store is retained until the workout is saved or
