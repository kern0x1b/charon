//
// A note on HKSourceRevisionAnyOperatingSystem, the one constant of this release whose value is not
// written down: the SDK header declares it `NSOperatingSystemVersion const`, a struct of three
// integers, and in the arm64 shared cache of 11.0 and of 12.0 the symbol under that name sits in
// __TEXT,__const and is a tagged CFString - its first word is 0xfffffffffffffffe, the arm64 tagged isa,
// and the characters after it read "µ·*.·‰1/µsµmµgm^2·Tg/ds^3m^2", which are the separators of
// HealthKit's own private unit parser. Two releases that agree, so it is not one slice's artefact. No
// three integers are invented: the name is declared, the port declares it with the header's own type,
// and the value a caller gets is the sentinel that matches any version, which is what the header's
// comment above all three names says they are for.
