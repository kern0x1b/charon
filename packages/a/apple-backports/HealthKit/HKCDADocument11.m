// HKCDADocument, the document a CDA document sample holds: the data, the title and the three names of
// the people it is about.
//
// The class is of iOS 11.0, not of 10.0: the corpus dates HKCDADocumentSample and its members to 10.0 by
// the version of the class they sit in, and the class itself arrived a release later. So the document
// is a file of its own, of 11.0, and the 10.0 group that the corpus dated its five members to does not
// carry them. That is the release check the gate runs, finding HKDocument10.m holding two releases.
//
// AND THE NAME IS AN ALIAS, because the release carries this class from 10.0.1 and exports it only from
// 11.0. Measured with apple.objc.inventory and apple.dyld over the caches this package is built for:
// 10.0.1, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3.4 (armv7s) all carry HKCDADocument in HealthKit's __objc_classlist -
// superclass NSObject, fifteen own methods of its own, adopting no protocol - and no image of any of
// them exports _OBJC_CLASS_$_HKCDADocument or its metaclass, while 11.0 (arm64) exports both from
// HealthKit. So a band of 10.0.1 to 10.3.4 that linked the class implementation this file used to hold
// would have two classes of one name in every process, and the runtime keeps the one it registered
// first, which is the release's. The name therefore goes through charon_alias.h, which is what
// modules/apple/backports.lua's own check asks for when it reads this reading ("the release carries
// HKCDADocument in HealthKit without exporting it: alias it through charon_alias.h") and what
// MDLMeshBufferZoneDefault, NSTextList and NSTextTab already are for the same one.
//
// The members are a CATEGORY on Charon's own name, which ld64 merges into the proxy: a class
// implementation here would be that second class on every band from 10.0.1 on. A category cannot add an
// instance variable and neither can the class behind an alias (attach.c lays the proxy out from the
// release's class and takes that write back when the two instance sizes differ), so the document's own
// five values are an associated object - the shape CarPlay's CPListItem row and ModelIO's mesh buffer
// zone already use.
//
// What each band answers, all three measured above:
//   * From 11.0 the release exports the name, the band reexports the symbol and links neither the
//     category's object nor the proxy, and HealthKit's own class answers.
//   * On 10.0.1 to 10.3.4 the release's class answers -documentData, -title, -patientName, -authorName
//     and -custodianName, and this category is attached only where the class does not answer the
//     selector: the five-argument -charon_initWithDocumentData: and this file's -initWithCoder: and
//     -encodeWithCoder: are the port's own there (HealthKit's are the -omittedContentFlags: spellings),
//     while -copyWithZone:, -isEqual:, -hash and -description are NSObject's or the release's and this
//     category's copies of them are not attached. Nothing in such a band makes a document of ours:
//     HKDocument10.o is reexported there, measured with band() at 10.0.1 and 10.3.4, so the sample's own
//     -document is Apple's there and Apple's allocator of documents is Apple's.
//   * Below 10.0.1 the release has no HealthKit class of this name at all, the proxy IS the class, and
//     every method below answers with the state beside it.
//
// What is not measured: nothing here was run on a device, and a document Apple's own sample hands out
// on 10.x and a document of ours below 10.0.1 are different objects by construction.
