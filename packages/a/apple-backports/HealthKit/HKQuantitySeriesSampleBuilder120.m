// HKQuantitySeriesSampleBuilder of iOS 12.0: a series of quantity samples, built one quantity at a
// time and handed over when the series is finished.
//
// One object per release: this file is of 12.0 alone.
//
// The contract is the host's own, read off it. A quantity of a unit the series' type does not accept is
// refused with com.apple.healthkit 3 and a wording that names both the quantity's unit and the type;
// a date before the builder's own start is refused the same way with a wording that names both dates; a
// builder that has been finished refuses the next insert the same way again. A builder that has been
// DISCARDED does not answer an error at all - it raises, and the exception is NSGenericException with
// the text "HKQuantitySeriesSampleBuilder already discarded." - which is a different kind of answer
// from a finished one and is why this port raises there and returns an error everywhere else.
//
// The release's own spelling of the insert is -insertQuantity:date:error:, which answers a BOOL and
// writes an NSError, and the arm64 image of 12.0 carries exactly one insert spelling and it is that
// one. The two forms the 26.2 header puts beside it - insertQuantity:dateInterval:completion: and the
// -initWithHealthStore:quantityType:startDate:device:error: initialiser - are of 13.0, and the image
// carries neither: by string count, insertQuantity:date:error: is 1 in the image of 12.0 and both
// insertQuantity:dateInterval:error: and insertQuantity:dateInterval:completion: are 0, so that one
// spelling is the image's whole insert surface. Of the two finishes the image carries only
// -finishSeriesWithMetadata:completion: while the header gives that form and
// -finishSeriesWithMetadata:endDate:completion: both at the class's own level. The disagreement is
// recorded in facts/HealthKit/HealthKit.md, and the form the 12.0 image does not carry is not carried
// here.
//
// What -finishSeriesWithMetadata:completion: returns for a series is **not measured**: on this machine
// the host's HealthKit has no entitlement and answers the finish with samples nil and com.apple.healthkit
// 1, "Health data is unavailable on this device", having refused nothing before it. The shape of the
// samples is therefore this port's own reading of the header - one quantity sample per inserted
// quantity, from the builder's start date to the date that quantity was inserted at - and the device
// test is what would settle it.
