// The iOS 9.0 form of HKAnchoredObjectQuery, and the six members of HKHealthStore of that release.
// Each is a file of its own: one object carries the API of one release.
//
// What arrived in 9.0 is that an anchored query can keep running - the update handler is what it is
// told with, and the results handler's form of the same release reports the deletions as
// HKDeletedObject instances rather than as a count - and, of the store, the two bulk deletes, the
// host's own device, the Fitzpatrick skin type, the extension's authorization, the earliest date a
// sample may have, and the energy split.
