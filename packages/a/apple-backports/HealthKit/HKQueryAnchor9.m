// HKQueryAnchor: how far a query of this store has been answered.
//
// The class arrived in iOS 9.0, so it is a file of its own: one object carries the API of one
// release (COORDINATION section 5, "one release per object file, or check_registry fails").
//
// An anchor is the store's own write sequence. The release's anchor is an opaque value the caller
// keeps and hands back, and +anchorFromValue: is how it makes one of those from a value it was given -
// a value a caller persisted between launches, in the archive of a previous one. This port's value is
// the sequence, as a number, which is what the store keeps its own anchors in and what a caller
// persists the same way.
