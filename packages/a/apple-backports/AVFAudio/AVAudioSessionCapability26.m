// AVAudioSessionCapability and AVAudioSessionPortExtensionBluetoothMicrophone of iOS 26.
//
// Both describe a facility of the audio route, and the whole question this port can answer honestly
// is whether the release has one. A capability answers its two questions as a device without the
// facility does: not supported, not enabled - the shape the header gives, and the shape a program
// that checks before using a facility on an old device already handles.
//
// What the release actually holds is read, not assumed: iOS 6.1.3's armv7 cache exports no
// AVAudioSession port-extension API, and its route is an AVAudioSessionRouteDescription of port types
// it names itself (the built-in microphone, the receiver, the headphones). A Bluetooth microphone of
// the kind these two classes describe - a far-field capture device or one that records at high
// quality over Bluetooth - is a hardware accessory this release's route has no way to name, so
// neither capability is supported.
