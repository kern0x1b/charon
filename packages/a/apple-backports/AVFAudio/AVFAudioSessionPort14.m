// The remaining port type strings, all read out of the host's own AVFAudio, which is the only
// source among those held that exports all of them (18.0 keeps them in a sub-cache of a split
// cache whose linkedit the pointer reader in .agent-work/plan-and-analysis/avfaudio/cfconst.lua
// does not reach; 7.0 and 12.0 predate most of them).  Their shapes are the port's own: the short
// names a port is known by, the same shape "CarAudio" and "ContinuityMicrophone" have in the
// releases that do export them.
