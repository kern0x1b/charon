// AVAudioApplication of iOS 17 and the continuity-microphone port type that came with it.
//
// The one thing this class has to get right is the record permission, because a caller that reads it
// is deciding whether to show a prompt. iOS 6's AVAudioSession has no permission API at all - the
// first is iOS 7 - so where this process has loaded the AVFAudio backports, which carry that API,
// the answer is taken from it by message send (the class is looked up, so a process that has not
// loaded them is not made to fail for it); where it has not, the honest answer for a release that
// cannot report a permission is Undetermined, and a request asks. An application that reads the
// permission first and falls back to asking therefore behaves as it does on iOS 17, and one that
// needs the answer without asking is told Undetermined, which is what iOS 17 says for an application
// that has not asked. facts/AVFAudio/AVAudioApplication.md has the whole account.

// AVAudioApplicationRecordPermission, the three answers of iOS 17, in the header's own numbering.
