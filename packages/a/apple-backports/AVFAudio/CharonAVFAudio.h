// Shared private plumbing for the AVFAudio classes this folder carries. Nothing here is API: every
// name is Charon-prefixed, so modules/apple/backports.lua's internal_symbol() keeps it out of the
// library's exports, and a helper that exports none of its own takes the lowest minimum among the
// objects that name it (backports.lua's minimums(), third answer) - which is what lets a helper be
// reached from every band of the package.
//
// The C base is what the release already carries, measured against the real armv7 shared cache of
// iOS 6.1.3 (`dyld.load`, ~580 libraries): AudioToolbox exports the whole AudioComponent
// discovery family (AudioComponentCount, AudioComponentFindNext, AudioComponentGetDescription,
// AudioComponentCopyName, AudioComponentGetVersion, AudioComponentInstanceCanDo, AudioComponentCopyTags,
// AudioComponentRegister), the whole AudioUnit C API, the whole AUGraph API
// (NewAUGraph, AUGraphOpen, AUGraphAddNode, AUGraphNodeInfo, AUGraphConnectNodeInput,
// AUGraphSetNodeInputCallback, AUGraphInitialize, AUGraphStart, AUGraphStop) and AudioFile /
// ExtAudioFile; CoreAudio exports the whole AudioObject* family. So nothing below is answered with a
// value the release cannot produce.
//
// Host time is mach_absolute_time(), which is what AudioGetCurrentHostTime() returns and what an
// AudioTimeStamp's mHostTime holds - the SDK 26.2 CoreAudio.framework ships no header at all
// (Headers/CoreAudioTypes.h is its only one, and neither AudioGetCurrentHostTime nor
// AudioGetHostClockFrequency is declared in any header of the SDK), so the clock is read through
// libSystem's own mach_time.h rather than through a declaration this port would have to write out
// for itself. The two are the same clock: AudioFileSecondsToHostTime is documented as
// seconds * mach_frequency().
