// PHASEEnvelopeDistanceModelParameters: a distance model whose curve is a PHASEEnvelope.
//
// The header says what the envelope means here, and it is worth saying in the port's own words
// because it is the whole contract: "An envelope object where x values are interpreted as distance and
// the y values interpreted as gain", and on the property, "The x values are interpreted as distance and
// the y values are interpreted as gain."
//
// There is nothing to translate here - PHASE arrived in iOS 15 and the port's releases are 6.1.3 and
// 4.3, so no release has a PHASEDistanceModel to convert. What there is to carry is the holding of an
// envelope, and the fact that the class is only made the one way the header allows: -init and +new are
// NS_UNAVAILABLE and -initWithEnvelope: is the designated initializer, because a distance model with
// no envelope has no distance model in it.

    PHASEEnvelope *_charon_envelope;

    // [super init] is not available here and not a shortcut around it: the superclass,
    // PHASEDistanceModelParameters, marks -init NS_UNAVAILABLE and declares no designated
    // initializer to chain to, so a designated initializer on this class has to allocate the superclass
    // directly. It inherits no state - its only member is its own fadeOutParameters - and all this
    // class holds is the envelope below.
