// PHASEEnvelope: a segmented envelope, and the one place PHASE evaluates a curve of its own.
//
// The envelope is a start point and an ordered list of segments, each of which the header says carries
// no start point of its own - "so we can connect envelope segments together end to end and gaurantee
// continuity along the x and y axes" - so the segments partition the domain and the value at a point is
// the start point, or one segment's linear or curved run out of the previous one's end.
//
// evaluateForValue: maps a domain value onto the range by finding the segment whose x extent holds it
// and applying that segment's curve across it. The curves are the eleven cases of PHASECurveType, and
// each is a closed form from its own name: the powers are t^n and 1-(1-t)^n, the trigonometry is
// sin(t*pi/2) and 1-cos(t*pi/2), the logistics are a logistic in t normalised onto [0, 1], and the two
// steps are the values their names say.
