// AVAudioUnitMIDIInstrument over the release's own MusicDevice send API.
//
// A previous report of this family said the release "exports no function that sends a MIDI event to an
// audio unit". That was wrong, and the mistake is worth recording: the check that produced it grepped
// the AudioUnit* prefix and read the head of a truncated _AU* listing. The right measurement is over
// the whole of AudioToolbox, and it is:
//
//   $ python3 -c "...for e in at if e.startswith('_MusicDevice')..."
//   AudioToolbox exports matching _MusicDevice: ['_MusicDeviceMIDIEvent', '_MusicDeviceStartNote',
//   '_MusicDeviceStopNote', '_MusicDeviceSysEx']
//
// MusicDevice.h of SDK 16.4 documents MusicDeviceMIDIEvent as "Used to sent MIDI channel messages to
// an audio unit", with inUnit "The audio unit", inStatus "The MIDI status byte" and inData1/inData2
// "exactly as described by the MIDI specification, including the combination of channel and command in
// the status byte", all API_AVAILABLE(ios(5.0)). MusicDeviceSysEx is the non-channel form, and
// MusicDeviceStartNote/MusicDeviceStopNote are the extended note API that returns the note instance
// the same API group stops. So every channel message, the system-exclusive message and the note pair
// are the release's own calls.
//
// MusicDeviceMIDIEventList is NOT among the four exports, so -[AVAudioUnitMIDIInstrument
// sendMIDIEventList:] (iOS 16) is not carried: there is nothing on this release to call.
