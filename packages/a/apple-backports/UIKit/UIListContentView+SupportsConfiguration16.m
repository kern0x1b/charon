// -[UIContentView supportsConfiguration:], iOS 16.0.
//
// The header: "Whether this view is compatible with the provided configuration, meaning the view
// supports it being set to the `configuration` property and is capable of updating itself for the
// configuration. If not implemented, the view is assumed to be compatible with configuration classes
// that match the class of the view's existing configuration."
//
// The port has exactly one content view - UIListContentView, the one -[UIListContentConfiguration
// makeContentView] answers - and CharonConfigurationHost.m's install path already tests the header's
// own rule when it replaces a configuration: it reuses the installed view when the new configuration
// makes the same kind of view, and makes a new one otherwise. So this method answers that test
// instead of a second, weaker one, which is what lets a caller ask before installing.
