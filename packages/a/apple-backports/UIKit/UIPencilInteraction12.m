#import "CharonMenus.h"

// UIPencilInteraction, iOS 12.1. An interaction the port carries because an application strong-imports
// its class symbol, and whose event no device of this release can produce: the Apple Pencil is a stylus
// with its own radio and sensors, and no device this package runs on has one. The class is made, added to
// a view and removed like any other interaction, keeps its delegate weakly, and never calls back - the
// same shape UIScribbleInteraction carries for the same wall (facts/UIKit/UIInertInteractions.md).
//
// The two class properties answer the capability honestly. +preferredTapAction is the action to perform
// when the user taps the side of the pencil; with no pencil there is no tap and so no action, which is
// what UIPencilPreferredActionIgnore says in the SDK's own words ("No action, or the user has disabled
// pencil interactions in Accessibility settings"). It is not read from a preference: iOS 6 has no
// Settings pane for it, so there is nothing to read and Ignore is the only answer that is true.
// +prefersPencilOnlyDrawing is NO, which is what the host's own UIKit answers
// (facts/UIKit/UIPencilInteraction12.md).
