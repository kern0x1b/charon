// UITableView+PrefetchingEnabled15.m - the prefetching gate iOS 15.0 gave UITableView.
//
// One row: UITableView.prefetchingEnabled, introduced 15.0, minimum 6.0, so this file is one
// object's API and belongs to release 15 alone.
//
// WHY THIS ROW EXISTS AT ALL, which is the whole of it. The port already prefetches for table
// views - UITableView+Prefetching10.m holds the data source, computes the rows just past what is
// on screen, calls -tableView:prefetchRowsAtIndexPaths: and cancels what has scrolled away. It
// runs as soon as a prefetch data source is set, and it has no switch. The collection view's half
// of the same feature has one: UICollectionView+Prefetching10.m:121 gates its prefetch on
// `!source || !self.isPrefetchingEnabled`, and that file's own comment records where the gate's
// default came from - measured under Mac Catalyst, a freshly made collection view answers NO for
// isPrefetchingEnabled and nil for the data source.
//
// Apple's UITableView had no such switch in 10.0 and gained one in 15.0, so before this row the
// port's table prefetching was the one half of the feature that could not be turned off: a caller
// who set a prefetch data source and did not want prefetching had no way to say so, and a caller
// who wanted to know whether it was on could not ask. This is that switch, and the default is
// the one measured on the collection view's own side of the same port.
//
// The gate is applied by installing a layoutSubviews hook, the same way
// UITableView+Prefetching10.m:43 installs its own, and it REPLACES rather than adds: the
// collection view's file returns early at :35 when the release already answers the selector.
//
// Two hooks on one selector compose, and that was measured before this file was written rather
// than assumed: two classes each calling class_replaceMethod on -layoutSubviews in their +load,
// the second reading the IMP the first installed, and one -layoutSubviews call afterwards
// running the original, then the first hook, then the second. So the 10.0 hook and this one both
// run, in that order, and the prefetch pass still happens exactly once - the second hook finds
// every candidate already asked for, which is why asking for the gate first is what keeps a
// closed gate from reaching the data source at all.
//
// +load is required and is why the method is installed from a class and not from the category:
// +load runs before the library's own categories are attached, so a method added from a category
// would not be there yet (the reason UITableView+Prefetching10.m:38 spells out in its comment).
