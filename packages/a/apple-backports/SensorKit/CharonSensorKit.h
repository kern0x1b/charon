// What the lowered 16.4 SDK this package builds against cannot name, written out here so that an
// application compiled against SDK 26.2 finds the classes and the types it expects.
//
// SensorKit arrived in iOS 14 and the build's SDK is four minor versions behind the one this package
// develops against, so nineteen of the framework's thirty-eight classes are absent from those headers
// and twenty-five of its property types are absent with them: the string enumerations SensorKit names
// its values with, the option masks, the one plain typedef, and the one struct. Each is spelled here as
// the SDK 26.2 header spells it - the same superclass, the same selector, the same property name and
// type, no ivars - and the availability annotations are left out, which is what the other three
// redeclarations in this package do (CharonMetricKit.h, CharonSecurityUI.h, CharonAVAudioBuffer.h):
// they would be refused against this deployment target and they mean nothing in a translation unit that
// is not an application's.
//
// No header text is copied here and no enumerator is invented. A value of one of the enumerations is
// produced by the system reading a sensor, and there is no system here that does that, so the port never
// has to name one; an application that receives a value from a payload and puts it in one of these
// properties carries the value with it, and the property's type is what the header promises.

// MARK: - The types the build's SDK does not name, and the ones it does

// Ten of the twenty-five this header once carried are already in the 16.4 SDK and are left to it -
// SRAmbientLightSensorPlacement, SRAuthorizationStatus, SRCrownOrientation, SRDeletionReason,
// SRLocationCategory, SRMediaEventType, SRNotificationEvent, SRTextInputSessionType, SRWristLocation and
// the SRAmbientLightChromaticity struct - measured by compiling this header and reading which
// declarations it collided with. The fifteen below are the ones it does not have.
//
// A value of any of them is produced by the system reading a sensor, and there is no system here that
// does that, so the port never has to name one. That is why each of these is a typedef of its underlying
// type with no enumerator list: the ENUMERATORS are Apple's, and copying them would be copying a header
// to state a fact the port does not need. An application that receives a value in a payload and puts it
// in one of these properties carries the value with it, and the type is what the header promises.

// The one plain typedef: a time in seconds, the same type as the absolute time the four functions
// return.

// The one string: the identifier of a stream in the store, which is a name and not a number.
