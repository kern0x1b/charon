// The string constants of SensorKit after iOS 14.0, in ONE place, and read by both sides of the
// comparison that measures them.
//
// WHY A HEADER AND NOT SIX FILES' WORTH OF DEFINITIONS. An object carries the API of exactly one
// release (tools/release-split.lua refuses a file whose symbols first appear in two), so these
// eighteen constants belong to six objects - 15.0, 15.4, 16.4, 17.0, 17.4 and 26.0 - and each of those
// objects names only its own. Their VALUES, though, are one list, and the harness that proves them
// has to walk that whole list from a single host-compilable source: it links the port's own
// definitions into one process and prints them, and it hands the host's values from another. Writing
// the values twice - once in each release object, once in the harness - is the defect this header
// exists to prevent. So each release object defines its own guard and imports this, and the harness
// defines every guard and imports this, and there is one definition of each string in the tree.
//
// WHAT THE VALUES ARE. Every one of them is a const object-pointer VARIABLE in Apple's own headers -
// `SR_EXTERN SRSensor const SRSensorHeartRate` at SRSensors.h:276, `SR_EXTERN
// SRPhotoplethysmogramSampleUsage const SRPhotoplethysmogramSampleUsageDeepBreathing` at
// SRPhotoplethysmogramSample.h:223 - and SRSensor, SRPhotoplethysmogramSampleUsage and
// SRPhotoplethysmogramOpticalSampleCondition are each a typedef of NSString * in those headers. A
// variable has no value in a header at all, so no SDK this package compiles against spells one, and
// the 26.0 SDK that declares two of these names not their values either. The values here are the
// HOST's own SensorKit's, read out of it by dlsym: tests/backports/host/sensorkit-names opens
// /System/Library/Frameworks/SensorKit.framework in a process of its own and dereferences each
// symbol ONCE, because dlsym on a const object-pointer variable returns the address of the variable
// and the address of the variable is the string. That is what the values below are, byte for byte,
// and compare.py holds the two sides against each other name by name over the one list both walk.
//
// This is what the HOST's framework holds, and it is NOT a measurement of what an iOS device's
// SensorKit holds: no device has been asked. Every registry row for one of these names says so in its
// own effect, because a row that claims a device measurement it does not have is the defect this
// file's values would otherwise invite.
//
// Open source checked: swift-corelibs-foundation 6.x - not used. What is carried is Apple's own
// SensorKit surface, which no permitted project implements; the values are Apple's and the only
// honest source for them is Apple's own framework.
