// Only the time declarations, from the framework's own header: this file is the four time functions and
// needs nothing the port declares. That also keeps it buildable beside the host's own SensorKit, which is
// what the differential in tests/backports/host/sensorkit does - the port's class header would collide
// with the host's newer one.
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <SensorKit/SRAbsoluteTime.h>
#import <mach/mach_time.h>

// The four time functions, over the clocks this release actually has.
//
// The header says what each of them is, and the two limits are named here because the release is
// short of what the header describes:
//
//   SRAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent()  "This timestamp ticks across sleeps and reboots."
//   SRAbsoluteTimeFromContinuousTime(cont)
//       "Because mach_continuous_time is volatile and hardware specific, the mach_continuous_time must
//        originate from the same device and boot session..."
//
// Measured on the armv7 6.1.3 cache's 158 520 exports: mach_absolute_time, mach_timebase_info and
// CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent are all there, and **mach_continuous_time is not** - it arrived in iOS 10.
// So the clock that ticks across a sleep is not one this release has, and the port does not pretend:
//
//   - SRAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() reads mach_absolute_time, which STOPS while the device sleeps. It is
//     monotonic, so it never goes backwards and the two conversions round-trip exactly, but a sleep
//     does not advance it. That limit is this release's, and it is stated rather than papered over;
//   - the two clock bases are joined by one anchor, read from the release's own CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent
//     the first time it is needed. Neither number is invented: the anchor is a wall-clock reading the
//     release produced, and every conversion after it is arithmetic on the two clocks the release has;
//   - and SRAbsoluteTimeFromContinuousTime takes the nanosecond count the name says. The header's own
//     warning is the caller's to observe: a count from another boot session is undefined, and the port
//     does not check one, because nothing here can tell.

// The two bases, and the anchor that joins them. One anchor per process, read once, so that the
// conversions are each other's inverses to the last bit the clocks carry.
