// CharonSensorKitProtocols.h — the SensorKit protocols the generated protocol sources name.
//
// WHY THE PORT DECLARES THIS PROTOCOL'S BODY RATHER THAN FORWARD-DECLARING IT. Measured on this
// machine, and the earlier version of this file got it wrong:
//
//   forward declaration only   ->  the protocol IS emitted, and carries 0 method descriptions
//   a declared body (below)    ->  the protocol is emitted with 10 optional and 0 required
//
// Both were measured by compiling a probe that takes @protocol(SRSensorReaderDelegate) into a Protocol *
// and counts method descriptions, so the numbers here are the probe's and not this file's reading of
// itself. A forward declaration would leave an application that asks
// `[objc_getProtocol("SRSensorReaderDelegate") conformsToSelector:@selector(sensorReaderWillStartRecording:)]`
// a NO, for a method its own class implements — and each of the ten member rows would then be a promise
// with nothing behind it.
//
// A measurement that had to be got wrong first, and it is worth recording because it is the second time
// in this family a runtime answer was read without the reference being used: the first version of that
// probe put `(void)@protocol(X)` in a `static` function nothing calls, the linker dead-stripped it, and
// the probe printed "protocol ABSENT" for BOTH shapes. The protocol object was there the whole time. A
// probe must use what it is measuring, or it measures the linker.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO <SensorKit/SensorKit.h> IMPORT HERE, and it cost a build to find out. With the
// umbrella imported, clang reports
//
//   duplicate protocol definition of 'SRSensorReaderDelegate' is ignored [-Wduplicate-protocol]
//
// and uses APPLE'S declaration rather than the one below — measured on the generated object's own
// compile for armv7-apple-ios6.1.3. The metadata emitted would then be Apple's, carrying references into
// a framework this release does not have. So this header declares what it needs and nothing else: four
// @class lines and one untyped typedef, which is the same shape CharonSensorKit.h uses for the fifteen
// enumerations the build's SDK does not name.
//
// WHAT IS WRITTEN AND WHAT IS NOT. The ten declarations, their base class, their @optional-ness and their
// types are facts the contract needs and are spelled as SDK 26.2 spells them at SRSensorReader.h:21 to
// :86. No header text is copied: no comment, no documentation, no prose. The @class lines declare names
// without defining types, and the typedef is NSInteger because SRAuthorizationStatus is an NS_ENUM over
// NSInteger — so the method description's type encoding is the encoding Apple's is, which is what a
// conforming class compiled against the SDK has to agree with.

// authorization, and no system here does that.
