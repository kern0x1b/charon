// What the header says of `multiThreaded` is that the context may be used from more than one
// thread. The release has no such property and no way to be told, and its own context is entered
// through three entry points that are not safe to enter twice at once. So the flag is the port's,
// and it does the thing it says: with it set, every call that reaches the release's context through
// one of those three is serialised by a recursive lock the port owns, and a context is entered by
// one thread at a time. With the flag clear nothing is wrapped at all, and the release's own code
// runs untouched - the wrappers are not installed until an application first asks for the flag, and
// from then on every context pays one associated-object read to find out whether it wants the lock.

// presenting a renderbuffer of a context the same code just made current - and must not deadlock on
