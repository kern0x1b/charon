// ledger's own list of what is missing for them is nine properties and two constants. So this is
// nine properties over the release's objects, and not a second PKPass.
//
// The one thing this file does not do is answer a property whose answer is a Secure Element. The
// release has no `PKPaymentPass` and no `PKRemotePass` and the device has no Secure Element and no
// pass relay, so `paymentPass`, `secureElementPass` and `remotePass` are registry entries of status
// `absent` with those reasons and are not implemented here: a program that reaches them through the
// runtime gets no method, which is what an absent entry means, rather than a property that lies.

// own pass library reports the passes it recovered; the second is the notification a remote payment
