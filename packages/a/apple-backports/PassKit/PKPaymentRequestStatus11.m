// The five value classes of iOS 11's PassKit, in ONE object because all five arrived in 11.0: the
// release-split gate refuses an object carrying two releases' API, and these five first export at
// 11.0 together (measured, `python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py` over the held ladder: 11.0 for
// all five, and they are in no earlier rung).
//
// The five are the completion blocks' own value types, which is what decides they are CARRIED rather
// than absent, and the port's own carried classes are what decides it:
// PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController (8.0, PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController8.m) and
// PKPaymentAuthorizationController (10.0, PKPaymentAuthorizationController10.m) are classes this
// package already exports, and in iOS 11 Apple gave each delegate a `handler:` taking one of these
// five in place of the 8.0 `-completion:(void (^)(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus))`. Every one of those
// five delegate methods is API_AVAILABLE(macos(11.0), ios(11.0), watchos(4.0)) in the SDK 26.2's own
// PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate.h:60, :86, :97, :107 and PKPaymentAuthorizationController.h:64,
// :92, :97, :108 -- the same 11.0 as the classes. So without this object the port exports a
// controller whose delegate cannot be written: the SDK's own header names a type the port has not got.
//
// The standing rule the siblings' facts page records, applied here: `absent` is for absent HARDWARE,
// and the Secure Element is hardware whose absence is not why a class is missing -- a 4S-era iPod
// answers +canMakePayments NO, it does not lack the class. These five are further from the hardware
// than the controllers: none of them touches a Secure Element, a card or a payment at all. They hold
// a status, a list of errors, a list of summary items and a list of shipping methods, and they give
// them back. What the hardware makes IMPOSSIBLE - the pass, the payment, the sheet - stays absent in
// the rows that say so, and this object does not touch them.
//
// WHAT A CALLER GETS ON THIS RELEASE, which is the honest half and is in facts/PassKit/PassKit.md:
// the object stores what the delegate put in it and hands the same values back, `status` defaults to
// PKPaymentAuthorizationStatusSuccess and the two null_resettable error lists answer the EMPTY list
// rather than nil. The lists of SUMMARY ITEMS and SHIPPING METHODS can only ever hold what a caller
// can build here: there is no PKPaymentSummaryItem in this release at all (registry row, 8.0,
// absent) and no PKShippingMethod either (tools/cache-index/first-rung.py puts
// _OBJC_CLASS_$_PKShippingMethod at 8.0, so no release this port deploys on has it), so in practice
// they are the empty array on this device. That is the release's own limit and this object does not
// paper over it: it copies what it is given, and it is given an empty array.
//
// NOTHING OF ANOTHER RELEASE IS HERE, and that is not tidiness, it is the gate. The SDK this package
// is built against is 16.4, and its PKPaymentRequestStatus.h declares every property of these classes
// up to 16.4. Auto-synthesis would put the later ones' accessors in THIS object -- a 15.0
// `shippingMethods` and four 16.x properties in an 11.0 object -- so each one is @dynamic, which is
// what the tree uses for a property this release's object does not own (PDFAnnotation11.m's -bounds,
// MPSImageThreshold13.m). The accessors belong to the objects of their own releases.
//
// THE STAND-IN, for the host probe: see CharonPassKitStandin.h. Every line number in this file is the
// SDK 26.2's own, which is the SDK the registry's `introduced` column is measured from
// (coordination/corpus/sdk-26.2-surface.tsv); the 16.4 header this package compiles against declares the
// same members a few lines away.

// marking one is what makes the INHERITED -init unavailable to a caller -- so the port cannot answer
// that warning by declaring -init in an interface the SDK owns, which is the same reason
