// The three parts of a controller that describe hardware rather than input, and the protocol
// a controller, a keyboard and a mouse all answer to.
//
// Each of the three classes marks `- (instancetype)init NS_UNAVAILABLE` in the SDK 16.4
// header, so an application never makes one: it asks a controller, and -[GCController battery],
// -light and -haptics answer nil for a controller with no such hardware, which is what this
// port does too and what the header's own `nullable` on each of the three accessors says. The
// members are still carried and real, because the port's own profile machinery can and does
// make one: the class is built so a caller that holds one is not holding a trap.

// The header states the defaults plainly: batteryLevel "ranges from 0.0 (fully discharged) to
// 1.0 (100% charged) and defaults to 0", batteryState "defaults to GCControllerBatteryStateUnknown".
// Nothing about iOS 6 has a controller battery to move either value off those defaults, so a
// battery this port makes reports them and stays there - which is what a controller with no
// battery in it means, not a value invented to look busy.
