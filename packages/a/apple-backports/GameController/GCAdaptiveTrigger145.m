// A DualSense's adaptive trigger: a GCControllerButtonInput that is also a device the application
// commands a mode into.
//
// The three properties and the four setMode calls split the way the header says they do, and the
// host measures the split:
//
//   "mode ... reflects the physical state of the triggers - and requires a response from the
//    controller. It does not update immediately after calling -[GCDualSenseAdaptiveTrigger
//    setMode...]."
//
// Measured on the host's own trigger, built by the application with no controller behind it: every
// setMode call - off, feedback, weapon, vibration - leaves mode at 0 and status at 0, and armPosition
// stays 0 whatever the button's own value is. That is the honest contract here and not a stub: a mode
// the port set itself would be a mode no controller ever entered, and the header's own sentence says
// the value is the controller's answer, not the caller's.
//
// What the port does answer is what it can: the trigger is a real button, so its value, pressed and
// touched states and its handlers are this package's own button behaviour, and the four setMode calls
// accept what the caller passes and validate what the header says they can be - a start position and
// an end position that must be ordered, amplitudes and strengths clamped to the normalized range -
// and then report the mode they were asked for through -charon_requestedMode:, for the profile that
// owns the trigger to send when a controller is attached. On a device with no controller attached
// there is nothing to send it to, which is why the public properties answer what the host answers.
