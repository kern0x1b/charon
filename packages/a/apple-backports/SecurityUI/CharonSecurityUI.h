// SecurityUI arrived in iOS 18.4 and the SDK this package's build compiles against (16.4, lowered)
// has no SecurityUI.framework at all, so the class the port carries is declared here, spelled the way
// SFCertificatePresentation.h of SDK 26.2 spells it: the same superclass, the same selectors, the
// same properties and the same types, and no ivars, so an application compiled against the real
// header finds exactly the class this library exports. The only thing left out is the availability
// and unavailability annotations, which the compiler would refuse against this deployment target and
// which mean nothing in a translation unit that is not the application's.
//
// This is the same arrangement the port already uses where the SDK it builds against has no header:
// AVFoundation/CharonAVAudioBuffer.h redeclares AVAudioPCMBuffer, and CallKit/CharonCallKit.h
// redeclares the CXCallAction family.
