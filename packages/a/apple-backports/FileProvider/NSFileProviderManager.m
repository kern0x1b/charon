// NSFileProviderManager: the manager a file-provider extension and the system talk through.
//
// The framework arrived in iOS 11.0 and the release this backport is for has none of it: no
// FileProvider, and no extension host that would load one. So every member here answers as the
// host's own FileProvider answers on a machine with no domains, and the answers are MEASURED
// where the host could be measured and DOCUMENTED where it could not - the table in
// facts/FileProvider/Manager.md says which is which for each member, and this file does not claim
// more than that table gives.
//
// The three numbers that come from the host, and that the differential compares:
//   getDomainsWithCompletionHandler: -> an empty list AND an error, NSFileProviderErrorDomain -2001
//   managerForDomain:                -> a manager
//   the error codes                   -> the header's own, -1005 NoSuchItem and -1004
//                                        ServerUnreachable, in the domain NSFileProviderErrorDomain
//
// The members that would change the state of a machine - addDomain:, removeDomain:,
// removeAllDomains…, the known-folder claim, the URL-session task registration, the enumerator
// signalling - are FORBIDDEN on the host, so their answers come from the header and are the
// documented "there is no extension to do this" error.
