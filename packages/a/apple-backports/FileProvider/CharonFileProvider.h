//
//   $ grep -rn "claimKnownFolders" <16.4 SDK>/…/FileProvider.framework/Headers/*.h
//   (no output)
//
// while SDK 26.2 declares it in NSFileProviderKnownFolders.h, with
// `FILEPROVIDER_API_AVAILABILITY_DESKTOP` - which is what makes the corpus list it at 11.0 and the
// 16.4 headers silent about it. So it is declared here, in the 26.2 spelling, and the .m
// implements it. The pattern is VideoToolbox's CharonVideoToolbox.h: a header of the port's own
// that carries what the lifted SDK does not.
//
// FACTS ONLY, from the 26.2 headers and the corpus - not Apple's implementation and not a
// behaviour: the spellings, the types, and the availability macro, copied.

// declaration is made where it is missing and skipped where the SDK already has it: a second
// @interface for a class the SDK declares is a duplicate definition, which is what the host build
// answered before this guard.
// The disconnect enums are NOT in the same situation as the known folders, and the previous text
// here said they were. Both SDKs DECLARE the method -disconnectWithReason:options:completionHandler:
// - and NEITHER declares the two types it names: the macOS SDK has neither the types nor the
// method, and the iOS 16.4 SDK has the method and neither type. The types are therefore the port's
// own, and they are unguarded because there is nothing to guard against.

 The reason a domain is disconnected, and the options it is disconnected with.

 UNGUARDED, and the reason is measured: neither SDK has them. The iOS 16.4 SDK the port builds
 with declares -disconnectWithReason:options:completionHandler: in NSFileProviderManager.h and names
 two types it does not define; and the macOS SDK the host differential builds against has neither
 the types nor the method -

   $ grep -rn "NSFileProviderDisconnectReason\|disconnectWithReason" <macOS SDK>/…/FileProvider.framework/Headers
   (no output)
   $ ls <macOS SDK>/…/FileProvider.framework/Headers | grep -i disconnect
   (no header named for it)

 so there is no file to test with __has_include and nothing to guard against: both builds need
 these, and the port's own -disconnectWithReason:options:completionHandler: is the only declaration
 of it either of them has. Spelled as 26.2 spells them - the port's header carries the spellings,
 the macro and the behaviour.
