// MPSGraphTensorShapeOps180.m - the slice's UPDATE as 18.0 spells it: the same two methods as 17.4's with
// the three masks left out of them, which is what the header's own note says they are ("Creates a strided-
// slice update operation with zero masks"). Two methods of one release, both through the slice family's one
// seam in MPSGraph14.m; nothing here names a method of any other release.
//
// What the update does is measured and is 17.4's own measurement, in the header of that object: the result is
// the data tensor's own shape and elements with the update written over the region the starts, the ends and
// the strides select. These two rows differ from that object's in one thing only, and it is the thing this
// file is here for: with the masks left out, the region is the one the caller wrote down and nothing else,
// and the FED form is answered by the release - measured over a 2x4 with the starts, ends and strides fed as
// int32 of shape [2], where the fed form answers exactly what the written-down form answers (100, 200, 300,
// 400 | 1, 2, 3, 4) for a region of row 1 written down as a start of 1 and an end of 4.
