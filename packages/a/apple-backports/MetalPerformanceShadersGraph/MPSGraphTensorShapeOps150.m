// MPSGraphTensorShapeOps150.m - the six shape and axis operations that arrived with MPSGraph in 15.0: the
// two flattens, the two broadcasts and the three reverses. From the headers MPSGraphTensorShapeOps.h and
// MPSGraphTensorShapeOps.h's reshape header in the SDK of iOS 16.4, which declare all six, each with its own
// availability note (ios(15.0)).
//
// One object per release: this one names six methods of 15.0 and nothing of any other release. All six are
// one walk in MPSGraphInterpreter14.m - the result is the operand's elements in some other order or extent,
// and which axis of the result each axis of the operand feeds is the whole of the difference - so what is
// here is each method's own rule, and each of those is measured (facts/MetalPerformanceShadersGraph/Core.md):
//
//   - a flatten collapses every axis from the one named on into a single axis: axis 0 of a 2x4 is a 1x8 of the
//     operand's own bytes, axis 1 of a 2x4 is the 2x4 itself, and axis 0 of a 2x3x4 is a 1x24.
//   - a broadcast aligns the operand to the RIGHT of the shape given and wraps each axis that the shape makes
//     wider: a 2x4 into a 4x4 answers each of its rows twice, and into a 2x2x4 answers the 2x4 twice.
//   - a reverse flips the axes it is given and nothing else: axis 1 of a 2x4 of (1, 2, 3, 4 | 10, 20, 30, 40)
//     answers (4, 3, 2, 1 | 40, 30, 20, 10), axis 0 answers the two rows the other way round, and no axes at
//     all reverses every axis.

#pragma mark - the space-to-depth family of 15.0: two axes of a block and the axis the blocks go to

// The SPACE-TO-DEPTH of 15.0, which is the general form of 16.1 with two spatial axes and one block size
// for both of them, and every measurement of this family is in
// -charon_mps_blockShuffle:spatial:batch:block:toBatch:shuffle:name: and in
// facts/MetalPerformanceShadersGraph/Core.md. What is here is the 2D form's own rule about ITS two axes:
// widthAxis is the fastest-running dimension WITHIN the block and heightAxis the second, so the general form's
// spatialAxes list is (heightAxis, widthAxis) - measured, the two forms over the same operand and the same
// block answer byte for byte the same values - and the depth axis is where the blocks go.
//
// Measured over a [2, 2, 4] of (1, 2, 3, 4 | 5, 6, 7, 8 | 9, 10, 11, 12 | 13, 14, 15, 16) with widthAxis 2,
// heightAxis 1, depthAxis 0 and a block of 2: the result is an 8x1x2, and with usePixelShuffleOrder=NO it is
// (1, 3 | 9, 11 | 2, 4 | 10, 12 | 5, 7 | 13, 15 | 6, 8 | 14, 16) - the operand's batch coordinate varying
// fastest inside the result's depth axis - and with YES (1, 3 | 2, 4 | 5, 7 | 6, 8 | 9, 11 | 10, 12 | 13, 15 |
// 14, 16), the block's own two values contiguous in it. A block of ONE is the identity (a 2x2x4 of the same
// sixteen values), and the 2D form's refusals are the release's own: an axis outside the rank with the axis's
// name in the sentence ("invalid width_axis (3) for shape of rank 3"), the depth axis among the two spatial
// ones, and a block that does not divide the extent it is a block of ("block_size (4) must be multiple of
