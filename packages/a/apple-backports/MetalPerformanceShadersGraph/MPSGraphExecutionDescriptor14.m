// What a wait and a signal are, as this file's two descriptor classes both keep them, and what a run does
// with them. They are here and not in either @implementation because BOTH classes declare the two methods -
// MPSGraphExecutionDescriptor in MPSGraph.h and MPSGraphExecutableExecutionDescriptor in MPSGraphExecutable.h -
// and the storage is two arrays either way.
//
// Measured on this host's own MPSGraph: a fresh id<MTLSharedEvent>'s own signaledValue is 0, and naming the
// event in either descriptor does not change it, so the only thing a run can do with one is to write it at the
// stage the caller named - and the one stage the header names is MPSGraphExecutionStageCompleted (0), which is
// measured and not assumed.
