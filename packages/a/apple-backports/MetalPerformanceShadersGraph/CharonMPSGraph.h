// added, asking each one to fill its outputs. A tensor's value is found by looking it up: a

//     stepping by the stride, so it is the walk above with an offset and a stride in it;
//   - the slice's GRADIENT (@"sliceGradient") is a scatter: the result is a tensor of the FORWARD INPUT's
//     shape - which is why the shape arrives as a tensor, either a constant the graph knows at build time or
//     a feed it reads when the graph runs - and the gradient's elements are written into the region the slice
//     selects, every other element a zero (measured: the release writes those zeros over a destination that
//     was filled with a pattern);
//   - the slice's UPDATE (@"sliceUpdate") is a copy and a scatter: the result is the DATA tensor's own
//     elements with the update written over the region the slice selects, which replaces and does not add.
// Everything the plan needs is in `parameters` - which direction (@"gather"), the starts, the ends, the
// strides and the three masks (@"sliceStarts", @"sliceEnds", @"sliceStrides", @"sliceStartMask",
// @"sliceEndMask", @"sliceSqueezeMask"), whether an end is really a SIZE (@"sliceSizes"), the forward
// input's shape where the graph already knows it (@"sliceForwardShape") and the index in `inputs` where the
// slice's fed parameters start (@"sliceFedFrom"), so a release's factory fills those in and names only its
// own methods. The fed form of a parameter the result's SHAPE depends on is one the release cannot build a
// graph over at all (measured: every fed gather parameter, and the fed slice of 18.2, die in its own
// NDArray), which is why the port refuses a floating point one and reads the rest when the graph runs.
