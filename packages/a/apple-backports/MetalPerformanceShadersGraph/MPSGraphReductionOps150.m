// MPSGraphReductionOps150.m - the four operations of the reduction and arithmetic headers that arrived
// with MPSGraph in 15.0: the two argument reductions and the two binary NaN-propagating extremes.
// From the headers MPSGraphReductionOps.h and MPSGraphArithmeticOps.h in the SDK of iOS 16.4, which
// declare all four, with their own availability notes (ios(15.0) for each).
//
// One object per release: the band machinery keeps an object whole or drops it whole, so a file here
// carries the API of exactly one release. This one names four methods and no other, and it builds them
// through the seam on MPSGraph in CharonMPSGraph.h, which is where the axis arithmetic and the result's
// shape are and which no 14.0 object names anything of this release for.

#import "CharonMPSGraph.h"

@implementation MPSGraph (CharonMPSGraphReduction150)

// The two argument reductions answer the index of the extreme rather than the extreme, which is the
// only difference between them and the two that arrived in 14.0. Measured on this host's own MPSGraph,
// over the sixteen classes the committed cases use and over rows chosen for their ties, in float32,
// float16 and int32 alike:
//
//  - the answer is the index of the FIRST element holding the extreme, so a row of (4, 4, 4, 9) answers
//    3 for a maximum and a row of (9, 9, 1, 1) answers 0 and 2 - a comparison that replaced on equality
//    would answer the last of the three, and the release does not.
//  - a NaN loses every comparison and so is never the answer, wherever it sits: (nan, 1, 2, 3) answers 3
//    for a maximum and 1 for a minimum, (1, 2, 3, nan) answers 2 and 0, and a row of nine with a NaN at
//    either end answers 8 and 7 for a maximum.
//  - a reduced set of nothing but NaNs answers -1 in both, which is "nothing was found" rather than an
//    index into an empty set.
//  - the result is stored as MPSDataTypeInt32 whatever the operand's own type is, and the two signed
//    zeros compare equal, so (0, -0, 0, -0) answers 0 for both.
//
// So the two of them are a maximum and a minimum with @YES where the walk keeps the index instead of the
// value, and the result type the release stores them in. Nothing else about them differs from 14.0's,
// which is why they go through the same seam with the same combination.

// (0, -0, +inf, -inf, NaN, -NaN, 1.4e-45, 2) - the four NaN positions answer a NaN each and the four
// ordinary ones answer what 14.0's pair answers over the same feeds (0, -1, -0, -inf), so the only
