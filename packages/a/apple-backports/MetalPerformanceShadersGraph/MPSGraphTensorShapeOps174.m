// MPSGraphTensorShapeOps174.m - the slice's UPDATE as 17.4 spells it: the written-down form with the three
// masks and the fed form beside it, two methods of one release, both of which go through the slice family's
// one seam in MPSGraph14.m. Nothing here names a method of any other release.
//
// An update is the third direction of the slice family's one arithmetic: the result is the DATA tensor's own
// shape, the data's own elements, with the update written OVER the region the same starts, ends and strides
// select. Measured on this host's own MPSGraph over a 2x4 of (100, 200, 300, 400 | 500, 600, 700, 800):
//
//   - the update REPLACES and does not add: the region row 0, columns 1 and 2 updated with (-1, -2) answers
//     (100, -1, -2, 400 | 500, 600, 700, 800), so the data is there byte for byte everywhere else;
//   - the masks are the slice's own masks, measured: with startMask over axis 0, a written start of 1 and an
//     end of 2 over a 2x4, the whole axis is written, which is what a start of zero and an end of two say;
//   - a NEGATIVE stride writes the update's elements along the region's own order, measured: a region that
//     walks axis 1 from 3 with a stride of -1 puts the update's first element at index 3;
//   - the update's shape must BE the region's shape: one wider than the region and one narrower than it are
//     both refused by the release's own compiler ("Optimize Original Module MLIR pass manager failed"), which
//     is why the plan refuses them where the graph is built;
//   - an endMask and a squeezeMask are refused the same way on an update, measured over four shapes of the
//     update and three masks each: the port answers them, and the rows name the divergence.
//
// The FED form is the one fed parameter the release answers, and the reason is the family's own rule: the
// result's shape is the DATA tensor's own, which the graph knows when it is built, so the starts, the ends
// and the strides can arrive as data - measured, an update whose starts, ends and strides are fed of int32
// answers exactly what the written-down form answers. Every other fed parameter of this family is one the
// result's shape depends on, and those the release cannot build a graph over at all.
