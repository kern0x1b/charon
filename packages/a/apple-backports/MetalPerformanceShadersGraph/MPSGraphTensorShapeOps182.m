// MPSGraphTensorShapeOps182.m - the slice family as 18.2 spells it: the two FED slice forms and the two FED
// gradient forms, four methods of one release, all through the slice family's one seam in MPSGraph14.m.
// Nothing here names a method of any other release.
//
// WHAT 18.2'S FOUR METHODS ARE, MEASURED ON THIS HOST'S OWN MPSGRAPH, and it is the same measurement for all
// four: a parameter that arrives as DATA and that the RESULT'S SHAPE depends on is one the release cannot
// build a graph over. Every form here takes the result's shape out of fed tensors - the starts and the ends
// (or the sizes) of `sliceTensor:startTensor:endTensor:strideTensor:...:`, and the shape of the forward
// input of `sliceGradientTensor:...` - and every form dies in the release's own NDArray:
//
//   "Error: NDArray dimension length > INT_MAX" (MPSNDArray.mm:759), exit 134, whatever the fed tensor is
//   made of: an int32 of shape [2], an int32 of shape [1], an int64 of shape [2] and the SIZE form's own
//   `sliceTensor:startTensor:sizeTensor:squeezeMask:name:` all answer that, and an int32 of shape [2,1] and a
//   float32 of shape [2] fail a step earlier in the release's compiler ("Optimize Original Module MLIR pass
//   manager failed").
//
// The gradient's fed forms are the exception in kind rather than in the answer: their result's shape is nil
// on the release's own tensor, before the run and after it, and the process writes the gradient's element 0
// into the destination's element 0 and nothing else, whatever the destination's shape is (measured over five
// shapes of the destination and five shapes of the forward input, all one element).
//
// So these four rows are the family's named divergences: each carries the release's own words and its exit
// status, and the port answers the header - the slice over the starts, ends and strides the caller fed, and
// the gradient of the forward input's shape the caller fed, both read when the graph runs, which is the only
// time a fed value is there to read. The rest of the family's measurements are in
// facts/MetalPerformanceShadersGraph/Core.md and in the header of MPSGraphTensorShapeOps174.m.
