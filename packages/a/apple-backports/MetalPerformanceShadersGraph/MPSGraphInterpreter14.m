//   element is folded into the position after it.

// reverse one (24, 24, 12, 4 | 240000, 24000, 1200, 40), which is the same rule and not a second one; a
// cumulative maximum is the row itself, (1, 2, 3, 4 | 10, 20, 30, 40), and an exclusive reverse maximum is
// (4, 4, 4, -inf | 40, 40, 40, -inf) - the seed where the walk starts, and the mirror of a forward
// exclusive maximum's (-inf, 1, 2, 3). A negative axis is the axis counted from the end, measured: axis:-1
// answers what axis:1 answers.
//
// A NaN loses every comparison and is skipped, as in the reduction family, so the position whose whole side
// of the walk is NaN answers the seed: measured over a row of (1, 2, 3, NaN), a reverse exclusive maximum
// answers (3, 3, -inf, -inf) and a reverse exclusive minimum (2, 3, +inf, +inf), and a forward exclusive
// maximum over the same row answers (-inf, 1, 2, 3). The accumulator is the result's own storage, so every
// partial answer is the value that type can hold: measured, the cumulative sum of (1, 2, 3, 4) in float16
// is 0x4900 = 10 and the cumulative product of four halves of 65504 is an infinity from the second step.
// The seed a scan of the two extremes starts from, and it is NOT the reduction family's infinity: measured,
// an exclusive cumulative maximum of a 2x4 answers 0xff7fffff at the position the walk starts and an
// exclusive cumulative minimum answers 0x7f7fffff there, in float32; in float16 they are 0xfbff and 0x7bff,
// the largest finite half of each sign, and in int32 they are INT32_MIN and INT32_MAX. So the seed is the
// type's own extreme FINITE value - the identity of a comparison over the values that type can hold - while
// the reduction family of 14.0 seeds an infinity, which is a different kernel and a different measurement and
// is left as it is. A sum's seed is the zero of the type and a product's its one, in every type measured.

//     ITSELF (measured: axis -1 of a 2x4 is the trailing unit axis of a 2x4x1). All three answer the
//     operand's own bytes in the operand's own order, which is what makes them one gather with the axes left
//     alone: a 1x2x4 squeezed is a 2x4 of the same bytes, a 2x4 expanded at axis 0 is a 1x2x4 of the same
//     bytes, and a 2x3x4 flattened at axis 0 is a 1x24 of them.
//   - a reshape is the same walk with the axes left alone and the result's shape the caller's: a 2x4 into a
//     4x2 answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40) and a 2x4 into a 1x8 the operand's own eight values, neither of
//     which moves an element, and a dynamic extent (the header's -1) is the element count over the product of
//     the extents written down (measured: a 2x4 into @[@4, -1] answers a 4x2).
//   - a flatten collapses every axis from its axis on into one.
//   - a broadcast aligns the operand to the RIGHT of the shape given, takes the LARGER of the two extents on
//     every axis they share (measured: a 2x4 into a 4x4 answers a 4x4 and a 2x4 into a 1x4 answers the 2x4
//     itself), repeats the whole operand for each axis the shape adds at the front (measured: a 2x4 into a
//     2x2x4 answers the 2x4 twice) and DOES NOT WRAP: past the operand's own extent the result is a zero,
//     measured over a destination filled with a pattern, where a 2x4 into a 4x4 answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20,
//     30, 40) and then eight zeros rather than the pattern and rather than the row twice.
//   - a reverse flips the axes it is given and nothing else, counting a negative axis from the end (measured:
//     axes @[@-1] answers what axes @[@1] answers) and taking no axes at all as every axis.
//
// An axis or an extent the release refuses is refused here too, with NSInvalidArgumentException: a squeeze of
// an axis whose extent is not one is a graph it cannot build (measured: "squeezed axis must have length 1,
// input.shape[1] == 2", then "LLVM ERROR: Failed to infer result type(s)" takes the process down), an axis or
// a permutation outside the rank is the same refusal the reduction family raises (measured for the reverse:
// "invalid axis: 5, axis must be in range - rank <= axis < rank, rank = 2"), and an extent of zero is a shape
// with no elements in it.
//
// Two questions this function is asked twice, and both are the same code: the factory asks it when the graph
// is built so that the result tensor carries its shape before anything runs - which is what the release does,
// since it infers the result's type at build time and aborts there over an axis it cannot use - and the
// interpreter asks it when the operation runs, which is the only time a FED parameter can be read. A fed
// parameter, and an operand whose own shape is not known yet (a gather of a fed gather), give nil here, and
// the interpreter puts the shape on when it walks the operation.
//
// `fed` is one entry per parameter the caller fed rather than wrote down, in the order the operation's own
// inputs carry them after the ones the walk reads as the operand: the gathers above take one (an axis, a set
// of axes, a shape), and the slice family takes up to three (the starts, the ends or the sizes, and the
// strides), which is why it is a list and not a single array. Its first entry is what the branches above read
// as the fed parameter, so they are unchanged by it.

        //     endMask over axis 1 from a start of 1 answers three elements, 2, 3 and 4, and a written end of
