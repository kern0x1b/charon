// MPSGraph, from the header of MPSGraph.h in the SDK of iOS 16.4: the graph the operations are added to,
// the placeholders that are fed at run time, and the two ways to run it.
//
// The graph is a description, so running it means walking the operations in the order they were added
// and asking each one to fill its outputs from its inputs and the feeds. A tensor's value is found by
// looking it up: a placeholder's comes from the feeds, any other one's from the operation that produced
// it, which is why the operations are walked in the order they were added - an operation can only read
// what an earlier one wrote.

// writes one; a unary one takes the first and writes one; a clamped one takes the two and a lower and an

// this framework.

// What all eight of these share: a set of axes of the operand's rank, and a result whose shape is the
// operand's with those axes taken out. Three questions about the set are answered by measurement rather
// than by the reading, and every one of them is a case in tests/backports/host/mpsgraph/graph-cases.m:
//
//   - an axis may be negative and is counted from the end of the rank, so -1 is the last axis and -2
//     the one before it. Measured: reductionSumWithTensor:axis:-1 over a 2x4 answers a 2x1 of the same
//     bytes as axis:1, and axis:-2 the same as axis:0.
//   - the order the axes are written in does not matter, and an axis written twice reduces once, so the
//     set is a set. Measured: axes:@[@1,@0] and axes:@[@0,@1] over the same 2x4 both answer a 1x1 of
//     110, and axes:@[@0,@0] answers the same bytes and the same 1x4 as axes:@[@0].
//   - nil reduces every axis and an empty array reduces none. Measured: axes:nil over the 2x4 answers a
//     1x1 of 110, and axes:@[] answers the 2x4 the operand already was, byte for byte.
//
// `parameters` is what tells the walk in MPSGraphInterpreter14.m which fold to run, so that this object
// and every later release's object share one walk and neither names the other's operations: what is
// added here on top of the axes and the result's shape is only what this release's own eight differ in,
// which is the two that latch a NaN.
// An axis outside the rank is a graph that cannot be built, and the framework refuses it in a way a
// caller cannot catch: measured on this host's own MPSGraph, reductionSumWithTensor:axis:5 over a 2x4
// writes "invalid axes: 5" and then dies with "LLVM ERROR: Failed to infer result type(s)", so the
// process is gone before any answer. There is no way to reproduce that from a port, and returning a
// tensor for it would be an answer the release does not give at all, so this raises instead - which is
// the one form of "this graph is not buildable" a caller can handle and is decided when the graph is
// built rather than left to be discovered as a wrong number later. Every later release's reduction goes
// through the same seam and is refused the same way: the argument reductions of 15.0 were measured

#pragma mark - the concat family of 14.0: the one walk whose result is SEVERAL operands
// The three concatenations MPSGraph itself arrived with, over the header's own three forms: two tensors, any
// number of them, and any number of them interleaved. They are one walk in MPSGraphInterpreter14.m, which
// derives the result's shape from the operands' own shapes and lays a region of the axis per operand, so
// what is here is each method's own rule about which axis and whether the regions interleave.
//
// Measured on this host's own MPSGraph, over a 2x4 of (1, 2, 3, 4 | 10, 20, 30, 40) beside one of
// (5, 6, 7, 8 | 50, 60, 70, 80) and one of (9, 10, 11, 12 | 90, 100, 110, 120):
//   - END TO END along the axis, in the order the caller wrote them: axis 0 of the three is a 6x4 holding
//     the three 2x4s in that order, and axis 1 a 2x12 holding their rows side by side. The two-tensor form
//     answers the same thing as the many over two operands, and a negative axis is counted from the end.
//   - INTERLEAVED along the axis, which puts operand i's coordinate c at the result's coordinate
//     i + c * (the number of operands): axis 1 of two is a 2x8 of (1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4, 8 | 10, 50, 20, 60,
//     30, 70, 40, 80) and axis 1 of three a 2x12 of (1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 10, 3, 7, 11, 4, 8, 12 | 10, 50, 90,
//     20, 60, 100, 30, 70, 110, 40, 80, 120). The result's extent on that axis is the SUM either way, and
//     the interleave form with NO answers exactly what the many-operand form answers.
//   - one operand is the identity: a 2x4 on its own is a 2x4 of its own eight values.
//   - every axis but the one named must hold the SAME extent in every operand, which the header calls
//     "broadcast compatible" and the release does not take: measured, a 1x4 beside a 2x4 with the concat on
//     axis 1 is refused by its own compiler with "'mps.concat' op invalid input tensor shapes, all input
//     shapes must match except at axis" (MPSGraphUtilities.mm:748), and the port raises there instead.
//   - an axis outside the rank is refused by the release's own compiler - "invalid axis tensor: [2], axis
//     must be in range -rank <= axis < rank, rank = 2" - and then "LLVM ERROR: Failed to infer result
//     type(s)" takes the process down with it, so the port raises where the graph is built.
//   - an EMPTY ARRAY is NOT a refusal, and the port answers it the way the release does rather than the way
//     this row first claimed. Measured on this host's own MPSGraph over the whole path, `concatTensors:@[]`
//     builds the result tensor with its shape NIL and its data type FLOAT32, `compileWithDevice:` returns an
//     executable and the run leaves the caller's destination as it was. So the result tensor here carries no
//     shape and no value; see the seam below for where that comes from.

#pragma mark - the space-to-depth family: four operations of 15.0 and 16.1 that are ONE chain of walks
// What every operation of this family does, measured: it moves a BLOCK of the operand's spatial axes into
// the batch axis, or out of it, and the result's batch axis holds the operand's batch coordinate woven with
// the block's own coordinates. Two shapes of answer, and which one is which is what the header's
// usePixelShuffleOrder says - with YES the block's own coordinates are CONTIGUOUS in the result's batch axis
// and without it they are INTERLEAVED with the batch coordinate - and neither needs a walk of its own:
//
//   1. a RESHAPE that splits each spatial axis into its block rows and its block columns (for the two
//      operations that move the blocks TO the batch axis), or that merges them back (for the two that move
//      them FROM it), and splits or merges the batch axis the other way round;
//   2. a TRANSPOSE that puts the batch axis and the block's coordinates into the order the flag names;
//   3. the other half of the reshape.
//
// Every one of those three is a walk this library already has and the harness already compares - the reshape
// of 15.0 and the permutation transpose of 16.0 - so what is here is the chain, the order the axis is held
// in, and the rules the release refuses the family by.
//
// MEASURED on this host's own MPSGraph (macOS 27.0 build 26A428, M4 Pro, Metal 4) over a [3, 4, 6] of 1 to 72
// with a 2x2 block, the spatial axes @[@1, @2] and the batch axis @0, whose result is a [12, 2, 3]:
//
//   - THE BLOCK'S OWN COORDINATES ARE ORDERED WITH THE LAST SPATIAL AXIS FASTEST, which is what makes the 2D
//     form's two axis arguments read (widthAxis, heightAxis) with the width the fastest: measured, the 2D
//     form over the same operand answers byte for byte what the general form answers with
//     spatialAxes=@[@1, @2] and blockDimensions=@[@2, @2], and with THREE spatial axes the last of them
//     varies fastest of all.
//   - BLOCK DIMENSION i BELONGS TO SPATIAL AXIS i, and THE RESULT'S AXES ARE THE OPERAND'S OWN in the
//     operand's own order - the two together are what a list written the other way round is, and each is
//     measured over a [2, 4, 8] whose batch axis is 0: spatialAxes @[@1, @2] with block @[@4, @2] answers a
//     [16, 1, 4] - axis 1 over ITS OWN block of 4 is 1 and axis 2 over its own block of 2 is 4, so the result
//     holds the operand's axes and not the list's - and spatialAxes @[@2, @1] with the same @[@4, @2]
//     answers a [16, 2, 2], which is the same two numbers read positionally against the other list.
//     A list written the other way round with the blocks swapped to match pairs each axis with its own block
//     again and answers the SAME shape and DIFFERENT bytes: spatialAxes @[@1, @2] with block @[@2, @4] and
//     spatialAxes @[@2, @1] with block @[@4, @2] are both a [16, 2, 2] and not the same bytes, and with an
//     EQUAL block the two are both a [8, 1, 2] over a [2, 2, 4] and still not the same bytes - because the
//     block's own coordinate runs in the LIST's order, with the last of them fastest, whichever order that
//     is.
//   - WITH usePixelShuffleOrder=NO the batch coordinate is the FASTEST of the two in the result's batch axis:
//     the result's batch coordinate d' is d + D*k, where D is the operand's own batch extent and k is the
//     block's own coordinate in its row-major order - measured over the [3, 4, 6]: the elements at
//     (0, 0, w even) are at the result's d' = 0, those at (1, 0, w even) at d' = 1 and those at (0, 1, w even)
//     at d' = 6, and the odd half of each of those at d' = 3, 4 and 9.
//   - WITH usePixelShuffleOrder=YES the block's own coordinate is the fastest: d' is d*(the product of the
//     block) + k - measured, the same operand's (0, 0, w even) at d' = 0, (0, 0, w odd) at d' = 1,
//     (0, 1, w even) at d' = 2 and (1, 0, w even) at d' = 4.
//   - THE RESULT'S SHAPE is the operand's own with the batch axis made D*times the product of the block and
//     every spatial axis made extent/block - measured [3, 4, 6] -> [12, 2, 3] - and for the other direction the
//     same statement the other way round, the batch axis made D over the product of the block and every
//     spatial axis extent times its own.
//   - EACH OPERATION IS THE INVERSE OF ITS PARTNER WITH THE SAME FLAG, and the round trip is the IDENTITY:
//     measured, a space-to-depth over the [3, 4, 6] and then the depth-to-space of what it built answers
//     1 to 72 in the operand's own order, and a space-to-batch and then a batch-to-space does the same, for
//     BOTH flags. That is the header's own "This operation is the inverse of" sentence measured rather than
//     assumed, and it is why the two directions are one chain run forwards and one run backwards here.

// Measured on this host's own MPSGraph over thirty-seven configurations - .agent-work/probe/fedshape.m, one
// case per process under a timeout, the raw run beside it - the rank of that vector is:
//

//   flatten   TWO, whatever the axis is, because a flatten2D's result is of rank two whatever it collapses -
//             measured over a fed tensor of rank one, of two and of none.
//   squeeze   the operand's rank LESS the axes the fed tensor names, because that is how many axes it takes

//     rank: 2 should match `multiplier` length: 3", MPSGraphUtilities.mm:1258). Both are raised here.
//   - FOR EACH AXIS j from 0 to rank-2 the multiplier m[j+1] is a WINDOW of m[j+1] terms along axis j, at
//     axis j's OWN STRIDE, weighted one each, and a term that leaves the axis is DROPPED and not clamped:
//     over a 4x4 of (1 ... 16), m[1] of 2 answers 6, 8, 10, 12 | 14, 16, 18, 20 | 22, 24, 26, 28 | 13, 14,

//     three rows of each are the window cut short by the end of the axis, which is what "dropped" means.
//   - the windows COMPOSE ACROSS AXES, and each axis's window is taken of the INCOMING GRADIENT and not of
//     the sum so far, so a rank of three with (3, 3, 3) is the 3x3 box around each element of the leading
//     block and a rank of two with (3, 3) is three terms and not six: measured, a 4x4 with (2, 2) answers
//     byte for byte what a 4x4 with (1, 2) answers, and a 4x4 with (3, 3) what a 4x4 with (1, 3) answers.
//   - m[0] IS NOT READ while it is at most the leading extent: measured, the gradient is answered unchanged
//     for m[0] of 1 and 2 on an 8x4, of 1 to 4 on a 4x4, of 1 to 5 on a 3x4, of 1 to 8 on a 2x4, of 1 to 3
//     on a 5x4 and of 1 and 2 on a 6x4. Above the leading extent the release's answer STOPS BEING THE
//     GRADIENT OF THE INCOMING GRADIENT and starts reading the SOURCE instead - measured, a gradient of
//     (1, 2, 4, 8, ...) with a source of ones and m[0] of 3 answers twice the gradient, while the same
//     source of (1, 2, 4, 8, ...) with a gradient of ONES answers 2, 4, 7, 12, 21, 38, 71, 136 - which is
//     the source's own elements and not the gradient's. An operation whose answer depends on the forward
//     operand is not a gradient, and there is no rule here to reproduce, so a leading multiplier above the
//     leading extent is refused and the row says so.
//   - AN ENTRY OF ZERO answers ZEROS, wherever it is: measured over a 4x4, (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (0, 2)
//     and (0, 0) all answer sixteen zeros.
//
// So the answer is the sum of the incoming gradient and one term per shift of every axis, every term sliced
// out of the INCOMING GRADIENT with that axis's own stride as the shift - which drops what runs off the end
// of the axis, because a slice's result coordinate with no element of the operand behind it is a zero, and
// that is the whole of "dropped and not clamped".

// than leaving to look like an oversight.

// Measured on this host: a fresh id<MTLSharedEvent>'s own signaledValue is 0 and naming it in a descriptor
// does not change it, so writing it is the only thing a run can do with one.
