// The two settings below are answered for the same reason and with the same shape as
// ARWorldTrackingConfiguration's in ARConfiguration2.m, and the reason is measured there: nothing
// about them needs a sensor this device has not. The pictures to look for are found in the camera's
// own frames, and how many of them at once is a number the caller sets, so what the header's own
// attributes say is what these answer -- the set is copied, so a later change to the caller's set
// does not change the configuration, and nil resets it, which for a `null_resettable` property means
// empty rather than nil. The release has both pairs in this class's own instance list
// (`detectionImages` 0x1af1684fc, `setDetectionImages:` 0x1af16850c, `maximumNumberOfTrackedImages`
// 0x1af168558, `setMaximumNumberOfTrackedImages:` 0x1af166620 in ARKitCore of the 16.0 arm64e cache).
//
// What the tracker does with either is a separate question and this file does not answer it, here or
// there: the tracker matches features between consecutive frames and reports planes, and it names
// neither ARReferenceImage nor ARImageAnchor, so no image anchor is ever reported and the number
// limits nothing. The two rows say so.
