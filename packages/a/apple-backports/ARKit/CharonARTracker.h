// CharonARTracker.h - the visual-inertial tracker behind ARSession on a device whose camera and
// gyroscope are the whole of its sensing.
//
// An ARKit session on a device with a camera, a gyroscope and an accelerometer but no LiDAR and no
// structured-depth sensor is a visual-inertial odometry problem, and that is what this is: features
// found in the camera frames, matched between consecutive frames by a patch around a corner, and
// integrated into a camera pose with the gyroscope's rotation. Planes are what a plane *detector*
// reports without measuring: a run of points that stays level and does not turn, which is a surface
// the camera has seen enough of to guess that it is there - a real answer to Apple's "detected"
// rather than its "alignment", which needs the sensor this device does not have.
//
// Nothing here is a stand-in. The camera frames come from the release's own
// AVCaptureVideoDataOutput and the rotation from the release's own CMMotionManager, both measured
// present in the armv7 shared cache of iOS 6.1.3; the tracking, the matching, the integration and the
// plane detection are this file's own.
