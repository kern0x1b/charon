// vDSP.h declares `struct vDSP_biquadm_SetupStruct` and `struct vDSP_biquadm_SetupStructD` and publishes
// no layout for either, saying only that the contents "may change from release to release" and that a
// caller should manipulate the values through the setup and setter routines. So the layout is the port's to
// define, and these two definitions are it: a caller only ever passes the pointer around.
//
// The delay is two doubles per section and channel, which is the state of one biquad section in transposed
// direct form II - the form whose two state values carry the input and the output history of the last two
// samples, and which is what the release's own answer is (measured: a section with b0 = 1 and a1 = 0.5
// answers 1, -0.5, 0.25, -0.125, ... to an impulse, which is that recursion and only that one).
//
// The name carries a Charon prefix on purpose, as CharonLinearAlgebra.h's does: the gate does not weigh a
// symbol of the port's own against a release or ask the registry about it (modules/apple/backports.lua,
// internal_symbol). The two structs themselves are the release's own names, because vDSP.h names them and
// a client's declarations must match.

//
//   - A float setup has the target in place before the first sample when interp_rate is 0 or the distance
//     from the coefficient to the target is at most interp_threshold, and otherwise approaches it at every
//     sample: the sample is filtered with the coefficient as it stands, and the coefficient then moves by
//     (target - coefficient) * (1 - interp_rate), or lands exactly on the target when what is left is at
//     most the threshold. Measured with b0 going from 1 to 9 and a threshold of 0.25, a rate of 0.5 has
//     the samples of one call answer 1, 5, 7, 8, 8.5, 9, 9, 9, a rate of 0.1 answers 1, 8.2, 9, a rate of
//     0.9 answers 1, 1.8, 2.52, 3.168, and a rate of 0 or a threshold of 100 puts 9 in front of them all.
//   - A double setup has the target in place before the first sample whatever the rate and the threshold
//     are: the same four parameter sets answer 9, 9, 9, 9 from the first sample, where the float setup of
//     the first two answers 1, 5, 7 and 1, 8.2, 9. So for a double setup the two rate arguments are stored
//     and change nothing, which is what `interpolates` records and what the registry entries for
//     vDSP_biquadm_SetTargetsSingleD and vDSP_biquadm_SetTargetsDoubleD say (facts/Accelerate/vDSPBiquad.md).
//
// What is above is the *isolated* walk, one section, and it is what this answers for every number of
// sections. A cascade of two or more walks differently - the snap lands a step later, so a two-section setup
// whose sections go 2 -> 4 and 5 -> 10 answers 37.5 and 38.75 where the release answers 35.1562 and
// 37.5391. That is measured, it is audible, and the rule behind it is not yet read off, so it is stated
