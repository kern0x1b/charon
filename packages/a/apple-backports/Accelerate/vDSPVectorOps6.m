// vDSP_vsmsma, iOS 6.0. The ladder puts it at 6.0.
//
// **The whole specification is one line of the header's Maps comment**, under the declaration:
//
//     E[n] = A[n]*B[0] + C[n]*D[0];
//
// **B and D are one scalar each.** `__B` and `__D` are typed as `const float *` because that is how a scalar is
// spelled, and reading the signature alone invites an array of per-channel scalars with an index that the
// signature nowhere supplies. The formula names `B[0]` and `D[0]`, so each is read once and every element
// multiplies and adds by the same two numbers.
//
// The arithmetic is left to right in the caller's own type: the product is formed in float and the add is a
// float add, so nothing is accumulated in a wider type. The differential pre-fills **the whole of E** over an
// array longer than any call here and compares every element of it, so the gaps between the stride's steps
// are required to come back exactly as they went in — a port that wrote E densely would pass a test that only
// looked at the elements it meant to write.
//
// **A 6.0 row in a file named for 6.0**, and the load cap and the empty-image install defect mean this is
// measured on the host so far: the guest is the oracle and has not run yet, so the registry row is inert.
