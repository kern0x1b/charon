// vForce's cube root, the two entry points iOS 8.0 added: vvcbrt and vvcbrtf.
//
// Measured from the release's armv7 caches, 8.0 is the first held release that exports the two, so this
// file holds the API of exactly one release. vForce's header says of the whole family that it "may treat
// some or all denormal numbers as zero" and that "the exact value returned and treatment of denormal
// values will vary across different microarchitectures and versions of the operating system", so the two
// are answered with libm's cbrt - the same number the header's own pseudocode computes - and the host
// differential compares them with a tolerance, and its numbers are what facts/Accelerate/vForce.md
// records.

// The length is a pointer and the caller names it there, as vForce's whole family does - an array of one is
// the common case and a NULL length is a caller's mistake the header does not describe, so it does nothing.
