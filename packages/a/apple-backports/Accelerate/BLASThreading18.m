// BLASSetThreading and BLASGetThreading, the threading model of iOS 18.
//
// The setting is per thread, as the header says: it is kept in thread-local storage, so a thread that
// has set one and a thread that has not answer differently, and the default a thread starts with is
// BLAS_THREADING_MULTI_THREADED, which is what the host answers for a thread that has set nothing
// (measured). A value the library does not have is refused with -1 and leaves the setting as it was
// (measured on the host: BLASSetThreading(99) answers -1 and BLASGetThreading still answers
// BLAS_THREADING_MULTI_THREADED afterwards).
//
// The header this API comes with is not in the SDK the port builds against: thread_api.h arrived with
// iOS 18 and the build SDK is 16.4, so the enumeration and the two prototypes are declared here, as
// the header declares them. The lift has to add the header for a program to name them
// (facts/Accelerate/BLASThreading.md).
//
// What the model does is worth reading before anything is built on it: the two functions are a value kept
// per thread, and nothing in the library reads it. The header calls the call "set the threading model to
// use for the subsequent calls into BLAS and LAPACK", and this port does not do that - it cannot, and
// neither does the host's own Accelerate, measured the same way: four threads inside cblas_sgemm leave
// the process with as many threads under the single-threaded model as under the multi-threaded one, so
// the setting does not bring the count down (facts/Accelerate/BLASThreading.md has the numbers). On the
// release there is nothing to set either: BLASSetThreading and BLASGetThreading are in the 18.0 cache and
// in none of 7.1.2, 8.0 and 16.0. So the setting is stored and read back, the two answers the
// header gives are the two answers this gives, and the difference between that and the header's wording
// is a documented one rather than a silent one.
