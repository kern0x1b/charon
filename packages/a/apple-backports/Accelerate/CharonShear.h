// The shears of vImage: the resampling engine, and the mapping the release's own workers compute.
//
// **The mapping, as the release computes it: one Q32 fixed-point accumulator, started once and advanced by a
// 64-bit integer step.** Read instruction by instruction out of the 6.1.3 armv7 workers and the 7.0 arm64 one
// and scored on the 6.1.3 guest against 1210 of 1210 named destination samples, at five scales, both axes and
// seven translates (facts/Accelerate/vImageGeometry.md, "The release's own position arithmetic" and "The two
// open terms closed"; the reading is the substrate, the count is the check). In the release's own order,
// because its rounding depends on it:
//
//     vertical     start = C*(1 - recip) + recip*t + (taps * -0.5) + 1.0        C = dest->height
//     horizontal   start = (row + 1 - dest->height) * (recip*slope)
//                          - recip*t + (taps * -0.5) + 1.0                     once per destination row
//     step           S   = (int64_t)(recip * 2^32)
//     A(along)        = (int64_t)(start * 2^32) + along*S, truncating, and one accumulator for the whole
//                        destination on the vertical; per row on the horizontal, whose start carries the slope
//     first tap       = (A >> 32) + the caller's offset along the shear
//     phase          = ((A & 0xffffffff) >> (32 - exponent)) & (phases - 1)     CharonResampling.h
//
// **There is NO half pixel in it, on either axis, at any scale.** The `1.0` and the `-0.5*numTaps` are what a
// half pixel does in macOS's arrangement; the `- 0.5` and the `+ 0.5` this file used to carry were that
// arrangement, and they are what four bands of host measurements converged on. **The vertical anchors at the
// destination's FAR edge and the horizontal at its NEAR edge**, which is the mirror the two axes have always
// shown here; `C` and the slope's row term are the two sides of it, and both are the DESTINATION's own
// extents (`vImage_Buffer` is `{data, height, width, rowBytes}`, so a vertical shear's along extent is
// `height` and a horizontal shear's across extent is `height` too).
//
// **Why it is an accumulator and not an expression in the destination coordinate.** Four bands searched
// "arrangements" of `centre = f(x)` and none of them could work, because no arrangement is a function of `x`
// at all: the release evaluates the position once per row and then adds a constant integer per sample. At a
// scale of 0.75 that constant is `4/3` a pixel with a `+-1/192` wobble, because `S mod 2^32` is `0x55555555`
// - `1/3` of a pixel short of a third - and a running fraction read a third short of `1/3` cycles 21, 42, 63.
// The port and the release were eleven sixty-fourths apart at every scale but one, and the eleven was that
// constant: the release's start fraction is `1/3` less a hundred-millionth and the port's was `1/2`.
//
// **The kernel is the caller's own.** The Q14 row, the phase it is read at and the base it is read around all
// come out of the release's filter object (CharonResampling.h), the divisor is that row's own sum, and the
// store rounds half up. Nothing here generates a weight: the release's stored integers are its own
// single-precision `sinf`, and a generated table would differ from the caller's numbers by construction.
//
// **The edging.** A tap outside the picture along the shear is REPLACED BY THE BACKCOLOR with its weight kept,
// not dropped: a source constant at 1.0 with a backColor of -1 makes the answer `2w - 1`. Under
// `kvImageEdgeExtend` the tap is pulled back to the edge instead, which is the header's own "the edge pixels of
// the source are extended". Neither mode renormalises over the survivors, which is what the overshoot at the
// last row is.
//
// **The refusals**, and they are the release's own: a NULL buffer is `kvImageNullPointerArgument`, a filter
// that is not a resampling filter is `kvImageInvalidParameter`, and a region or a destination that does not fit
// across the shear is `kvImageBufferSizeMismatch`. No flag is refused - every one of the thirty-two bits comes
// back `kvImageNoError`.

// The release ROUNDS to nearest at the store, and the rounding is half UP - toward plus infinity, not away from
// zero. Three independent measurements, each with a control where the answer must be exact:
//
// - **The store.** `CharonChannelPut` used to cast, which truncates toward zero. At a whole-pixel phase the
//   kernel is the single tap at `L(0) = 1` and the sum is that tap's own integer, so the host's stored value is
//   exactly the source value on 180 of 180 samples, a round to nearest reproduces 180 of 180 and the
//   truncation 29 of 180.
// - **The tie.** Over eighty cells of 180 samples - both axes, six translates, four slopes, both edging modes -
//   the release's own Q14 weights summed as integers and rounded half up reproduce the host's stored value on
//   14400 of 14400, and rounding half away from zero does not (`.agent-work/probe/vsweep.m`, ARGB16S).
// - **The ulp.** The 109 samples a previous pass found "off by exactly 255" are this and nothing else: on
//   `ARGB16S` the backColor is `(int16_t)(-1.0)` = `0xFFFF` for channels 2 and 3, a wholly-outside sample's
//   sum is `-1` to within one ulp of double, and the truncating cast answers `0x0000` where the host answers
//   `0xFFFF`. Ninety-eight of the 109 are that, on the low byte of a channel; the other eleven are the same
//   cast the other way. The whole count is on the four `ARGB16S` spellings and one sample each elsewhere.
//
// `CharonSaturate` runs first, so the rounding is applied to the value already clamped to the stored type's
// range, and `floor(x + 0.5)` is the half-up rule for negatives as well: -1.5 rounds to -1, which is what the
