// vDSP_distancesq, iOS 5.0. The ladder puts it at 5.0, so this is a 5.0 file and not one of the 6.0 files.
//
// **The whole specification is one line of the header's Maps comment**, which sits under the declaration:
//
//     C[0] = sum((A[n] - B[n]) ** 2, 0 <= n < N);
//
// One scalar out. `IA` and `IB` are the strides of the two inputs and there is **no inner count because there
// is no inner dimension** - the window is N elements long. That is the part worth being explicit about: a
// reading of the signature alone, with two input strides, one output and no window width, invites a port that
// writes one C per element, and nothing in the signature would catch it. The formula settles it, and the
// differential checks it by pre-filling the whole of C and requiring every element outside C[0] to be
// untouched.
//
// The accumulation is left to right in the caller's own type. The oracle is the release's own vDSP on the
// **5.1.1** guest, which is the nearest release this emulator holds that exports the function; the macOS
// arm64 host is a candidate here and not the oracle, because it has been wrong twice on rows that are native
// on older releases.
