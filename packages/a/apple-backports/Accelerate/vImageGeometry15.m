// The quarter turns of vImage at 15.0: the three half-precision shapes - vImageRotate90_ARGB16F over four
// channels, vImageRotate90_CbCr16F over two, vImageRotate90_Planar16F over one.
//
// The mapping and the loop are CharonGeometry.h's, and the half-precision shapes need nothing out of
// CharonVImageFixed.h: a quarter turn copies a pixel rather than computing one, so there is no half to be
// converted at all and the sixteen bits of a channel move as sixteen bits. That header is in the tree for
// the *other* half-precision work in this family, where a value is computed and does have to be rounded to
// the nearest half.
//
// kvImageUseFP16Accumulator is accepted on these three, as the header says, and changes nothing here: it
// is documented as making the *internal filtering* use half-precision arithmetic, and a quarter turn has no
// filtering. Saying so is better than silently ignoring a flag a caller set.
