/* The initialisers this package's own classes are built with, and nothing else.
 *
 * Core ML's classes arrive with no public initialiser: a feature description, a constraint, a
 * key and a model description are all made by a model and read by an application, and there is
 * no API for making one out of nothing. A port that has to build them -- and it does, because
 * the model reader has the specification's own fields and the classes have to be filled from
 * them -- needs an initialiser of its own, and it needs it to be the same one in every file that
 * builds one of these objects.
 *
 * That is all this header is: declarations of initialisers that the classes in this package
 * implement, for the other files of this package to call. They are not Core ML's API, nothing
 * exports them, and an application cannot reach one: each is declared as a category on a class
 * Core ML itself declares, which is a declaration and not a definition, and the definitions live
 * in the class's own implementation. The selectors they add are not in the registry, because
 * they are not part of the surface this port carries.
 *
 * A header rather than a .c or a .m file, for the reason CharonMLBridge.h gives: a .c file of
 * this package is compiled as C and cannot import Core ML, and a .m file is not compiled with
 * hidden visibility and would put these in the library's exports.
