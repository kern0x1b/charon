/* The Core ML strings an application reads out of the framework itself.
 *
 * These are the constants Core ML exports as symbols rather than as enum cases, so an
 * application that links against them needs the library to carry a definition of each: they are
 * not inlined at the call site the way a case of an enumeration is, and a declaration with no
 * symbol behind it is a link error rather than a value.
 *
 * Every value below was read out of a real Core ML on the host, through the framework's own
 * exported symbols, rather than written out from the name: the names are the specification's own
 * and give no hint of the value, and the error domain in particular is not the framework's name.
 * `tools/coreml/check-host.sh` records them again on every run and fails if one changes.
