/* The two Core ML protocols, and the two classes an application hands a model through.
 *
 * A protocol is not only a declaration: a class that conforms to one names a protocol object at
 * run time, and that object has to exist somewhere for `conformsToProtocol:` and
 * `objc_getProtocol` to answer. On a release that has Core ML, Core ML's own dylib carries it.
 * This release has no Core ML at all -- the classes are this port's own -- so the port carries
 * the protocols too, and that is why they are declared here rather than taken from Core ML's
 * header: a protocol the compiler has already seen declared is a *reference* to whatever
 * defines it, and a second declaration beside the first is ignored. Declared first, before
 * Core ML's header is imported, they are definitions, and the ones every other file of this
 * package refers to are these.
 *
 * The two declarations are Core ML's own, from its published headers: MLFeatureProvider is a set
 * of feature names and a lookup by name, MLBatchProvider is a count and a lookup by index.
 * Nothing else may be added to either, because an application that conforms to a protocol this
 * port carries has to be able to implement exactly the methods Core ML declares and no more.
 *
 * Then the classes: a prediction is made from a provider -- something that answers a value for a
 * name -- and the dictionary provider is the ordinary one, an NSDictionary of names to values,
 * which is what almost every caller already has. The batch provider is the same thing for a set
 * of inputs at once, and it is a provider of providers, so a model asked for a batch of
 * predictions is asked for one prediction per element of an array. Both are thin on purpose:
 * they hold what they were given and answer it by name or by index, and the work of deciding
 * whether a value is allowed is the feature description's, which is where the model's own rules
 * are.

 * it here made this object emit a definition that DISAGREED with the one the generated CoreMLBackportsProtocols11.0.m
 * emits -- this one gave the protocol the base <NSObject>, the 16.4 SDK's header gives it none -- and ld64 keeps
 * whichever of two weak definitions comes first on the link line, silently. MLBatchProvider is declared because no
 * registry row carries it, so nothing generates a second definition of that one, and nothing here emits it either.

 *   - a value that already is one is kept as it is;
 *   - an NSNumber is a whole number or a real by its own objCType, so @3 is an Int64 value and @3.0
 *     is a Double value. A model that counts what it is given and one that multiplies it are told
 *     apart by that, and a caller who wrote @3 meant a whole number;
 *   - a string, a multi array and a sequence are values of their own kinds;
 *   - an NSArray is a sequence, not a multi array: a sequence is the list Core ML types an input as
 *     when the model has no shape to give it, and a bare array of numbers has no shape either;
 *   - a dictionary is a dictionary value, whose numbers the interpreter can read;
 *   - anything else -- an NSObject, an NSData, an NSURL, a date -- becomes a value of the invalid
 *     type, and nothing is refused: there is no kind of feature value such an object could be, and
 *     a provider that refused to be made would leave the caller with no way to hand over the rest.
