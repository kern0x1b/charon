// GKBehavior.m -- a behaviour: the goals an agent is asked to satisfy, and how much each one counts.
// GameplayKit.framework carries no code at all before iOS 9 (GK_BASE_AVAILABILITY is
// NS_CLASS_AVAILABLE(10_11, 9_0) and the 6.1.3 armv7 cache exports no GameplayKit class), so this is
// this port's own; what the host does was measured by tests/backports/host/gameplaykit-core/measure.m:
//
//   The goals are in the order they were added, -goalCount and -objectAtIndexedSubscript: and the
//   fast enumeration all walk that order, and -weightForGoal: of a goal the behaviour does not have
//   is 0, measured. -objectForKeyedSubscript: of an absent goal is nil and -setObject:forKeyed-
//   Subscript: with a weight adds the goal if it is not there, measured.
//   +behaviorWithGoals: gives every goal a weight of 1, +behaviorWithGoals:andWeights: reads the
//   weights by the goal's index and raises NSRangeException when there are fewer of them than goals,
//   and a nil weights array leaves every goal at nothing -- all three measured over every combination
//   of up to three goals and up to three weights. +behaviorWithWeightedGoals: keeps the weights the
//   dictionary carries, which is what the method is for and what the host answers on this host
//   (measured: a dictionary of one goal at weight 3 gives that goal weight 3; the archived version
//   recorded the host dropping them to 0, and that no longer reproduces here -- see
//   facts/GameplayKit/Behavior.md, where both measurements are written down).
//   -copy is a new behaviour with the same goals in the same order and the same weights, measured.
//
// A goal is what an agent is asked to do: the twelve factories in GKGoal.m build one out of the
// arguments they name, and GKAgent reads it back when it decides. Nothing else of a goal is public,
// so what it holds is this port's own and carries the parameters of the factory it came from.
//
// -goalCount is the one property the SDK declares here, and it is answered from the array beside it,
// with a getter of the class's own, so clang auto-synthesizes nothing and the pragma the archived
// version silenced -Wobjc-missing-property-synthesis with is gone with the thing it hid.

#import "CharonGK.h"

// The goals in the order they were given, and the weight of each beside it. The weights are held
// beside the goals rather than in a dictionary keyed by them: a behaviour holds a handful of goals,
// so a scan is both cheap and free of any question about what a goal's own hashing answers, and the
// goals are matched by identity, which is what an application means when it asks for the weight of
// a goal it made.
