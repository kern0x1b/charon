// GKStateMachine.m -- a state and the machine that runs it. GameplayKit.framework carries no code
// at all before iOS 9 (the SDK's own GK_BASE_AVAILABILITY is NS_CLASS_AVAILABLE(10_11, 9_0) and the
// 6.1.3 armv7 shared cache exports no GameplayKit class at all), so this is this port's own; the
// machine's own rules were measured on the host and are what the two classes below do:
//
//   -[GKState isValidNextState:] answers YES for every class unless a subclass says otherwise, and
//   the machine has no states of its own to consult before one has been entered: a fresh machine
//   -canEnterState: is YES for any class, measured.
//   -enterState: is that predicate and no more. When it passes, the state being left is told
//   -willExitWithNextState: (nil if the class has no state in the machine), the new state is
//   remembered and told -didEnterWithPreviousState: (nil if there was none), measured; and when
//   the class names no state in the machine it still answers YES and leaves the machine with no
//   current state, having told the state it was leaving that, measured.
//   -stateForClass: is an exact match on the class of the states the machine was built with, so a
//   subclass with no state of its own in the machine is not found, measured.
//   -updateWithDeltaTime: goes to the current state alone, and to none when there is none, measured.
//   -enterState: asks -canEnterState:, which asks the state it is leaving, so a state that refuses a
//   transition is asked about it and refuses the entry as well, measured.
//   -init and +new raise GKInitNotAllowedException rather than building a machine with no states,
//   with the host's own reason and the host's own spelling of it, measured.
//
// The two properties the SDK declares here are weak or readonly, and both are answered from an ivar
// this file keeps, with a getter of the class's own: -Wobjc-missing-property-synthesis does not fire
// on a property a class answers itself, and the pragma the archived version silenced it with is
// gone. What would fire is a member the port does NOT carry and does not say so with @dynamic, and
// there is none here.
