// GKRandomDistribution.m -- the three distributions: the uniform one, the gaussian one and the
// shuffled one. Every one of them draws through the GKRandom protocol of the source it was given,
// and which protocol methods it calls was measured on the host with a source that logs them, by
// tests/backports/host/gameplaykit-core/measure.m:
//
//   -init and the range it builds are the degenerate distribution over 0 and 0, measured, and an
//   inverted range is kept rather than refused, measured.
//   GKRandomDistribution -nextIntWithUpperBound: asks the source for the range itself
//     ([source nextIntWithUpperBound:numberOfPossibleOutcomes]) and adds the lowest value;
//     -nextUniform is that integer over the highest value, so a d20 is quantised in steps of 1/20
//     exactly as its header says, and its range is [lowest / highest, 1.0] as the header says;
//     -nextBool is the source's own -nextBool; and -nextIntWithUpperBound: with a bound above the
//     range asks the source for no more than the range, so a bound of 3 over [2, 7] asks for 2, and a
//     bound of exactly 0 asks for the whole range whatever the lowest is.
//
//   GKGaussianDistribution -nextInt asks the source for two uniforms and applies the Box-Muller
//     transform to them, z = sqrt(-2 ln u1) cos(2 pi u2), and rounds mean + deviation * z, clamped
//     to the range. Over a source seeded with 1, whose first two uniforms are 0.0000895261837 and
//     0.731953204, that gives 9 for both (10, 2) and (10.5, 19/6), measured.
//
//   GKShuffledDistribution keeps a bag of every value in the range, shuffles it forward with a
//     Fisher-Yates that asks the source for bounds 1, 2, 3 ... and hands the values out from the
//     back of the bag, refilling it when it is empty. Measured: over a source that answers those
//     bounds 0, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5 it answers 6, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1, then 6, 3, 5, 4, 2, 1 for the bounds
//     0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, then 5, 1 for 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 3. The shuffle happens on the first draw, not
//     at init and not on -nextBool.
//
// Every property these three declare is readonly and is answered from an ivar this file keeps with a
// getter of the class's own, so clang auto-synthesizes none and the pragma the archived version
// silenced -Wobjc-missing-property-synthesis with is gone with the thing it hid.

// source, over the ranges -2..2, 0..2, 2..5 and 3..3 and every bound from 0 to 8:
