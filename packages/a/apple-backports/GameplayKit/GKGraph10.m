// GKGraph10.m -- the pathfinding graphs of GameplayKit as they arrived in iOS 10: the 3D node and the
// sphere obstacle, the three spatial indexes, the mesh graph, and the half of GKPath that is 3D.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE OBJECT FROM GKGraph9.m. An object carries the API of exactly one release
// (modules/apple/backports.lua's check_releases, read by tools/release-split.lua). Every class here is
// GK_BASE_AVAILABILITY_2, which GameplayKitBase.h:27 defines as NS_CLASS_AVAILABLE(10_12, 10_0), and so
// is -float2AtIndex:, -float3AtIndex: and the two -...WithFloat3Points: initialisers of GKPath
// (GKPath.h:22-23, :31-32). GKGraphNode2D, GKGridGraph, GKObstacleGraph, GKCircleObstacle,
// GKPolygonObstacle and the rest are GK_BASE_AVAILABILITY and are GKGraph9.m.
//
// WHAT THE HOST ANSWERS, and every number below is one of them; the measurements are in
// facts/GameplayKit/Graph.md and the checks that hold them are tests/backports/host/gameplaykit-graph.
//
// TWO PLACES WHERE THE HOST DISAGREES WITH ITS OWN HEADER, and which side this file takes. Both are
// measured, both are in measure.m, and neither is a difference this port can make disappear:
//
//   * -[GKQuadtreeNode quad] answers the zero quad for every node of every quadtree tried -- a quad
//     added at (3,3)-(5,5), a point at (1.1,1.1), a node in a 2x2 tree and a node in a 8x8 one, all four
//     answer 0,0..0,0. A node that came back with a region of zeros describes nothing, and the header
//     says the node's quad is the one its element was added with. So this file answers the real cell,
//     and the divergence is recorded rather than reproduced: an answer of zeros for a shape is the
//     silent fake coordination/crutches.md forbids, and a caller that reads it learns nothing.
//   * -elementsAtPoint: on a quadtree and an octtree. For an element added WITH A POINT it behaves as
//     the header describes and this file reproduces it exactly: the answer is the elements whose cell
//     holds the point, so an element at (0,0,0) in a tree of minimum cell size 2 is answered at
//     (1.999,0,0) and not at (2,0,0). For an element added WITH A BOX or A QUAD the host's own answers
//     do not follow the header: one quad added at (3,3)-(5,5) in a tree of minimum cell size 2 is
//     answered at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) and (3,3) and NOT at (4,4), (5,5), (6,6) or (7,7) -- that is, at
//     every point in the cells on one side of it and at no point in its own -- while in a tree of minimum
//     cell size 8, where there is one cell, it is answered at every point from (0,0) to (7,7). The rule
//     that fits those numbers is the cell index of the element's SIZE rather than of its position, which
//     is a walk of the wrong tree and not an answer any caller could use. So this file answers the
//     header's rule -- the elements whose region holds the point -- and holds it against the header and
//     the facts file rather than against a host number that contradicts itself.
//
// The shared arithmetic and the one search are in CharonGKGraph.m, a file that exports no API symbol.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <GameplayKit/GameplayKit.h>

#import "CharonGKGraph.h"

// The 9.0 half of this framework is GKGraph9.m, so the compiler says for each of its classes that the
// members declared there are not defined here. The suppression is that sentence and nothing else.
// --- the seams between the two objects of this family -------------------------------------------------
// An object holds the API of exactly one release, so GKPath's 9.0 half and its 10.0 half are two
// objects. An object's ivars are not visible to another object, so the storage the 10.0 members read is
// reached through charon_ accessors the 9.0 object defines and the 10.0 one calls -- the same shape
// CarPlay/CarPlayLane174.m uses for the two halves of CPLane. They are not API: charon_ is the prefix
// internal_symbol() leaves out of what a band is weighed against and out of what the library exports.
//
// @class rather than the class: this header is included by CharonGKGraph.m, which deliberately does not
// import <GameplayKit/GameplayKit.h> so that the framework's own availability annotations stay out of an
// object that defines none of its API.
