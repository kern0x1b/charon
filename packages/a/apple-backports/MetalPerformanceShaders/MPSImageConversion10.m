// MPSImageConversion, from MPSImageConversion.h of the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface: the filter that "performs
// a conversion from source to destination" (:19) - the colour channels' premultiplication and the
// destination's own shape.
//
// One object for one release: the class's own annotation above its @interface is ios(10.0)
// (MPSImageConversion.h:22) and nothing else is in this file.
//
// WHAT A CONVERSION IS, and it is written out in full rather than described. MPSImageTypes.h:32-41
// gives all nine cells of source against destination, each with the operation it performs:
//     NonPremultiplied -> NonPremultiplied    <none>
//     NonPremultiplied -> AlphaIsOne          composite with opaque background color
//     NonPremultiplied -> Premultiplied       multiply color channels by alpha
//     AlphaIsOne       -> NonPremultiplied    set alpha to 1
//     AlphaIsOne       -> AlphaIsOne          set alpha to 1
//     AlphaIsOne       -> Premultiplied       set alpha to 1
//     Premultiplied    -> NonPremultiplied    divide color channels by alpha
//     Premultiplied    -> AlphaIsOne          composite with opaque background color
//     Premultiplied    -> Premultiplied       <none>
// and MPSImageTypes.h:22 defines the terms: the colour channels of a premultiplied image "are stored
// instead as color * alpha", so multiplying is the way into that and dividing the way out of it. The
// nine cells are the switch below, because that is the table the header prints.
//
// The background colour is the other half of the composite cell. MPSImageConversion.h:49-53: "An array
// of CGFloats giving the background color to use when flattening an image. The color is in the source
// colorspace. The length of the array is the number of color channels in the src colorspace. If NULL,
// use {0}." So a NULL background is black and a flattening cell with no colour is a composite over
// black, which is what the header's own default means.
//
// OWED, refused by name rather than answered wrongly: the COLOUR SPACE conversion. The header's
// conversionInfo argument "May be NULL, indicating no color space conversions need to be done"
// (MPSImageConversion.h:56-57), and a non-NULL CGColorConversionInfoRef is opaque - CoreGraphics
// declares no accessor that reads the two spaces back out of one - so a converter built from it alone
// has no source space and no destination space to convert between, and CGColorConvert needs both. The
// NULL case, which is every conversion that does not change colour space, is the one carried here, and
// a conversionInfo this port cannot act on is refused by name at initialization rather than ignored.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. No number in this file is a measurement of Apple's code - the release's own MPS
// cannot run on this host, which facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Image9.md records. What is written here
// is transcribed from the header above; what has been checked is the armv7 link, that this object
// defines the class it says.
