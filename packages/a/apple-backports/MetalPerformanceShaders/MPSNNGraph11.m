// MPSNNGraph and the ten of its node classes that the export ladder places at iOS 11.0.
//
// ONE OF THREE OBJECTS, and the split is by what a client can BIND, which is what
// backports.lua's measured_names()/releases_in() measure. A class can be present in a release's ObjC
// inventory and its class symbol in no export trie of that release, and a client cannot link against what
// is not exported - so the release the gate places a name at is the first release that EXPORTS it, and
// that is what this file is named for. Measured with dyld.load + dyld.exported_at over the held ladder,
// armv7 preferred, taking the EARLIEST of the class symbol and the metaclass symbol as
// backports.lua:2368-2377 does:
//
//   MPSNNGraph11.m        11.0   MPSNNGraph MPSNNImageNode MPSNNDefaultPadding MPSNNAdditionNode
//                                MPSNNSubtractionNode MPSNNMultiplicationNode MPSNNDivisionNode
//                                MPSNNConcatenationNode MPSCNNPoolingAverageNode MPSCNNPoolingMaxNode
//   MPSNNFilterNode12.m   12.0   MPSNNFilterNode
//   MPSNNGraphNodes16.m   16.0   MPSNNStateNode MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode MPSCNNPoolingNode
//
// All fourteen agree on class and metaclass, so the earliest is the class's own. `first-rung.py` answers
// 11.0 for all fourteen and is right about the CLASSES and wrong about what a link needs: it reads the
// names file, which build.py:8 writes with `strings -a <cache> | grep -xF NAME`, so it finds a class that
// is in the cache and absent from its export trie. That is the difference this split rests on, and
// MPSNNFilterNode12.m and MPSNNGraphNodes16.m each carry their own measurement.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS. The graph itself, the padding policy, the elementwise filter nodes, the
// concatenation node, and the two concrete pooling nodes. Their BASES - MPSNNFilterNode,
// MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode, MPSCNNPoolingNode - are in the two later objects, and each of those bases is
// the superclass of classes that arrive earlier, which is Apple's export history rather than a hierarchy
// built by name at runtime: a subclass names its superclass as a link-time symbol and a band that keeps
// this object keeps those too.
//
// WHAT THE RELEASE'S OWN HEADERS SAY, and this file follows them rather than the earlier form of it:
//
//   * Five of the six `+paddingFor...` methods the earlier form defined are declared by NO Apple header.
//     MPSNNDefaultPadding declares four methods, in the SDKs of both 16.4 and 26.2: +paddingWithMethod:,
//     -label, and the two +paddingForTensorflow... . The five that are gone -
//     +paddingForTensorflowMaxPooling, +paddingForTensorflowConvolution, +paddingForCaffePooling,
//     +paddingForCaffeConvolution and +paddingForMXNetPadding - answer nothing to a grep over either
//     SDK's MetalPerformanceShaders headers. The earlier comment claimed the header "names" six pre-rolled
//     policies. A public class method no release ever had is API the port would be inventing.
//   * +paddingForTensorflowAveragePooling (MPSNeuralNetworkTypes.h:497) and
//     +paddingForTensorflowAveragePoolingValidOnly (:500) carry ios(11.3), and -inverse (:455) carries
//     the same date, so none of the three is here.
//   * The size policies are the header's own DestSize and Offset, transcribed in CharonMPSNN.h one for
//     one, and the coefficient is the size BITS MINUS ONE (`:339-341` declares ValidOnly 0, Same 1<<4,
//     Full 2<<4 and `:397-401` wants -1, 0, 1).
//
// THE -Wincomplete-implementation PAIRS THAT REMAIN HERE are the two for the classes in this file that
// declare methods they do not carry: MPSNNDefaultPadding's two ios(11.3) +paddingForTensorflow... and
// MPSNNGraph's eight. Each is a push/ignored/pop around one @implementation with its own list of names,
// header lines and releases - not a file-wide `#pragma clang diagnostic ignored` with no record of what
// it hides. The other two pairs moved with their classes.
//
// WHY THE GRAPH RUNS AT ALL ON iOS 6: nothing here needs Metal. MPSNNGraph walks the node graph it was
// given, and each node's encode runs the kernel object the node holds - an MPSImageAdd, a pooling
// kernel - over host memory behind an MTLBuffer, which is the path every other MPS kernel in this
// package takes (facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Cnn.md). The graph adds the walk, the shape arithmetic and
// the intermediate-image lifetime. It adds no arithmetic of its own that a kernel does not already do.
//
// NOT CLAIMED: a concatenation of two or more sources. MPSNNGraphNodes.h:2443-2446 pads EACH source out to
// a multiple of four channels, so two one-channel sources make an eight-channel destination, and
// MPSImage13.m holds one, two and four channels and refuses the rest. That limit is MPSImage's row.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED HERE AND WHY is listed at each class, where the warning for it is turned off.
