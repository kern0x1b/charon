// MPSImageThreshold13.m - the five threshold kernels, and the state they share.
//
// Each of the five answers one comparison per channel, and the comparison is the header's own:
// MPSImageThreshold.h states the formula for each, and this file implements those five and nothing else.
//
// The five all inherit directly from MPSUnaryImageKernel in the release's own hierarchy, and that
// hierarchy is kept: MPSImageThresholdToZero, …ToZeroInverse, …Binary, …BinaryInverse and …Truncate are
// declared there as subclasses of MPSUnaryImageKernel, and a class the SDK declares cannot be
// re-declared here. So there is no shared base class in the chain, and the three values the five hold -
// the threshold, the maximum and the transform - are declared in each of the five, and the code that
// fills them, applies them and runs the encode is a CATEGORY on MPSUnaryImageKernel, which the five call.
// The category holds no ivars of its own: on this fragile-ABI target a category cannot, and it does not
// need to, because the state is the five's.
//
// The threshold initialiser belongs to the thresholds, not to MPSUnaryImageKernel, which declares only
// -initWithDevice: (available, and used), so `[super initWithDevice:]` from each of the five is the
// kernel's own and needs no runtime detour. The arithmetic file's does not: MPSImageArithmetic's
// -initWithDevice: is NS_UNAVAILABLE and the arithmetic state lives on the class above it, which is why
// that one goes through objc_msgSendSuper.
//
// The threshold value is the caller's and the header makes it readonly - the initialiser sets it - and
// the header marks -initWithDevice: unavailable on all five, so this file does not define it on any of
// them: a kernel that was never given a value refuses to encode rather than answering against a zero it
// did not receive.
//
// The transform is the header's array of THREE floats, and its default is BT.601/JPEG, which
// MPSImageThreshold.h states five times, once per subclass:
//
//   @param transform  This matrix is an array of 3 floats. The default if no transform is specifed is
//                     BT.601/JPEG: {0.299f, 0.587f, 0.114f};
//
// A kernel of this family walks a one-channel image - MPSImage13.m refuses an image whose feature channel
// count is not one - so the transform's first entry is the whole of it.

#import "CharonMPSImage.h"

// No diagnostic is silenced in this file. What the build reports, with the pragmas stripped and
// -Wall -Wextra, is in the commits that removed the pragmas: the category declares a protocol and
// nothing of its own, so it declares no method it does not define, and the five conform through a
// category each.
//
// What the build still prints, and each KIND accounted for. The counts are the part that stays true;
// line numbers are not quoted, because this comment is itself inside the file and every one of them
// moved the moment it was written - a reader who followed :92 for the category landed twelve lines above
// it, and the same for the five pairs. So: the diagnostic and the count, and nothing that rots.
//
//   ONE   -Wobjc-protocol-method-implementation. Inherent to putting the shared encode in a category on
//          a class the SDK owns: the five classes implement it too, and the one that runs is the
//          category's.
//   FIVE  -Wincomplete-implementation and FIVE -Wobjc-designated-initializers, one pair per class, both
//          about 'initWithCoder:device:'. MPSKernel9.m:74-82 implements that initialiser once and the
//          five inherit it, and MPSImageThreshold.h declares it fifteen times without defining it on
//          any class, so the release does not define it per subclass either. It is the same owed
//          -initWithCoder:device: this series records on MPSMatrixRandomMTGP32 with an effect string.
//
// Nothing else, and the count is the check: 5 + 5 + 1 = 11, measured stripped of pragmas and asked with
// -Wall -Wextra, under the harness's own flags and under none. A twelfth entry is deliberately absent from
// the list: -Wincompatible-sysroot fires when -isysroot names the current directory, so it is a property
// of the command line and not of this file, and it appears under neither invocation.
//
//   --- MPSImageThreshold13, no pragma, -Wall -Wextra:
//         5 [-Wincomplete-implementation]

// single channel luminance image using the linearGrayColorTransform and then apply the threshold."
// That is ONE SCALAR LUMINANCE PER PIXEL - 0.299*r + 0.587*g + 0.114*b at the default - computed from
// the three channels and then thresholded ONCE.
//
// This file does not do that, and an earlier version of this comment claimed it did. What the code did
// was multiply each channel by its own coefficient and threshold each channel separately, which is not
// the header's rule and not any rule: for a 3-channel image that answers three comparisons where the
// header answers one, and it wrote three where the header writes one. Multiplying a single channel's
// value by 0.299 is not that either, which is how a one channel image came to answer 2.0 * 0.299 =
// 0.598 where the header's own formula says 2.0.
//
// So a multi channel image is REFUSED, the way the walk refuses an image it cannot walk, and this file
// answers only what it answers correctly: a ONE channel image, thresholded on its own value, which is
// what MPSImageThreshold.h:194 and its four siblings state. The luminance path is owed and is written
// down as owed in facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Image.md.
