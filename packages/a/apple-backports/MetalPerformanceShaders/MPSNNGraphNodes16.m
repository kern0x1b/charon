// MPSNNStateNode, MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode and MPSCNNPoolingNode - the three of this graph's node
// classes that the export ladder places at 16.0.
//
// ONE OBJECT FOR ONE RELEASE, and the release is 16.0. Each of the three is in the arm64 cache of the
// 11.0 release's own inventory - MPSNNStateNode with six instance selectors, MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode and
// MPSCNNPoolingNode both with MPSNNFilterNode as their superclass - and each of the three is in NO image's
// export trie at 11.0 or at 12.0. What a client can bind is what backports.lua's
// measured_names()/releases_in() place a name at, and for these three that is 16.0. Measured with
// dyld.load + dyld.exported_at over the held ladder (armv7 preferred), class symbol and metaclass symbol
// agreeing for all three:
//
//   11.0  MPSNNStateNode: no image    12.0: no image    16.0: MPSNeuralNetwork
//   11.0  MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode: no image    12.0: no image    16.0: exported
//   11.0  MPSCNNPoolingNode: no image    12.0: no image    16.0: exported
//
// ALL THREE ARE SUPERCLASSES OR BASES OF CLASSES THAT ARRIVE EARLIER, which is the same export history
// MPSNNFilterNode12.m records and costs nothing here: the hierarchy is not built by name at runtime, a
// subclass names its superclass as a link-time symbol, and a band that keeps an 11.0 object keeps this
// one too.
//
// WHY THESE THREE AND NOT OTHERS. The graph's fourteen classes land at three releases and this is the
// largest of the three groups:
//
//   11.0  MPSNNGraph MPSNNImageNode MPSNNDefaultPadding MPSNNAdditionNode MPSNNSubtractionNode
//         MPSNNMultiplicationNode MPSNNDivisionNode MPSNNConcatenationNode MPSCNNPoolingAverageNode
//         MPSCNNPoolingMaxNode                          -> MPSNNGraph11.m
//   12.0  MPSNNFilterNode                              -> MPSNNFilterNode12.m
//   16.0  MPSNNStateNode MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode MPSCNNPoolingNode   -> this file
//
// The grouping is by the EARLIEST of the class symbol and the metaclass symbol, which is what
// backports.lua:2368-2377 does - "A name arrives with the first of its symbols" - and for all fourteen
// the two agree, so the earliest is the class's own. Grouping by the class symbol alone would have been
// luck rather than method.
//
// WHAT EACH IS:
//
//   MPSNNStateNode      the graph's state POSITION, of which this port's graph carries none -
//                       MPSNNGraph.h:183-184 has the source states be the MPSState objects the caller
//                       passes in. The class is still built, because it is the base of the 12.0 gradient
//                       half this object does not carry and a caller holding an MPSNNStateNode* needs the
//                       base to exist.
//   MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode   the base of the four elementwise operations, over the two images
//                       MPSImageMath.h:34-37 names. Each subclass names one MPSImage kernel and nothing
//                       else; the four subclasses are in MPSNNGraph11.m.
//   MPSCNNPoolingNode   an abstract base that "does not correspond with any particular MPSCNNKernel"
//                       (MPSNNGraphNodes.h:1467-1471). The two 11.0 subclasses are in MPSNNGraph11.m.
//
// TWO METHODS OF MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode'S OWN @interface (MPSNNGraphNodes.h:2136-2216) are NOT
// implemented here, and both are the training half: `-gradientClass` at :2158 and
// `-gradientFiltersWithSources:` at :2162, which carries MPS_AVAILABLE_STARTING ios(11.3) and returns
// MPSNNGradientFilterNode*. Their registry rows are `owed` with that reason.
//
// MPSCNNPoolingNode's four accessors the base declares at :1472-1475 carry ios(12.0) and are NOT here.
// release-split reads band points, and a 12.0 name in a 16.0 object is a second kind of mixed release
// that this object does not have and would not survive a review.
