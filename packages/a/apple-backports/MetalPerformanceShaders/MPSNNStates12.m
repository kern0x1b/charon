// The two MPS states of the iOS 12 surface whose own superclass this package already carries:
// MPSCNNNormalizationMeanAndVarianceState and MPSRNNMatrixTrainingState, from MPSCNNBatchNormalization.h
// and MPSRNNLayer.h of the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface.
//
// ONE OBJECT FOR ONE RELEASE, and both classes are 12.0 by the ladder as well as by their headers -
// MPSCNNBatchNormalization.h:102 and MPSRNNLayer.h:1055 annotate ios(12.0), and the ladder says so too:
//
//   $ printf 'MPSCNNNormalizationMeanAndVarianceState\nMPSRNNMatrixTrainingState\n' \
//       | python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py
//   MPSCNNNormalizationMeanAndVarianceState   12.0
//   MPSRNNMatrixTrainingState                  12.0
//
// MPSNNPad, which the same surface annotates ios(12.1), is NOT here: no release is held between 12.0 and
// 16.0, so it reads 16.0 on the ladder and is MPSNNPad16.m's object. Their superclasses are carried:
// MPSState by MPSState11.m and MPSKernel by MPSKernel9.m.
//
// WHAT EACH ONE IS, in the headers' own words.
//
//   MPSCNNNormalizationMeanAndVarianceState is the pair of buffers a batch normalization gradient
//     accumulates: mean and variance, each an id<MTLBuffer>, from an initializer that takes them and a
//     class method that allocates them at numberOfFeatureChannels floats each. What FILLS them is the
//     gradient, which is ios(11.3) and another slice's object, so this one allocates and does not compute.
//
//   MPSRNNMatrixTrainingState declares NO member of its own - MPSRNNLayer.h's @interface is @end straight
//     after it (:1055-1056) - so the class exists so that a caller can name the state its training layer
//     hands back, and everything it can do is MPSState's.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CARRIED, and is named in the row rather than discovered later. Three classes of this
// surface are NOT here: MPSCNNYOLOLoss, MPSCNNYOLOSLossDescriptor and MPSRNNMatrixTrainingLayer. Each one
// declares a property whose TYPE is a class this package does not build - MPSCNNLoss, MPSCNNLossDescriptor
// and MPSRNNDescriptor respectively - and a class that reads a property of a class the library does not
// carry cannot be created at all: the runtime fails to make it and the failure takes the whole dylib with
// it. Those three rows say so, each naming the header line that names the missing type and the grep that
// shows nothing here declares it.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. No number in this file is a measurement of Apple's code - the release's own MPS
// cannot run on this host, which facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Image9.md records. What is written here is
// transcribed from the two headers above; what has been checked is the armv7 build of this directory, that
// every object compiles for armv7 and that a partial link over all of them leaves no MPS class undefined,
// and the commands are in facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Release12.md.
