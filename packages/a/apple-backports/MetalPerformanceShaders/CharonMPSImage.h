// CharonMPSImage.h - the walking layer this package's MPSImage kernels share.
//
// Every kernel in this family takes an MPSImage on each side and walks it pixel by pixel, so the walking
// is here once rather than in each kernel: a layout resolved once from the image, a read of one channel
// of one pixel, a write of the same, and a readBytes:/writeBytes: pair over a region.
//
// The channel format is a property of the image and a kernel does not choose it. This package compiles
// against the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface, where `MPSImageFeatureChannelFormat` names an element width —
// Unorm8, Unorm16, Float16, Float32 — and the channel count is the image's own `featureChannels`. There
// is no planar format in that surface, so the addressing is always interleaved: a pixel's channels sit
// together at `pixel * bytesPerPixel`, and a row is `bytesPerRow` from the next. Every read and write
// below goes through CharonMPSLoad/CharonMPSStore at the image's own element width — the same two the
// matrix kernels use, which is why they are not re-implemented here.
//
// MPSImage13.m holds the class: the texture, the descriptor, the properties and the two readBytes:/
// writeBytes: forms. This header is the arithmetic on top of them, and it reads and writes through that
// same pair - `MPSDataLayoutHeightxWidthxFeatureChannels`, the row-major order of a region, and the
// `MPSImageReadWriteParams` argument the 26.2 form carries - so a walk and a caller see the same bytes in
// the same order.
