// MPSImageGaussianPyramid, the one pyramid kernel the header calls "currently supported" under
// MPSImagePyramid (MPSImageConvolution.h:497-498), from the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface of
// MPSImageConvolution.h.
//
// One object for one release. MPSImageConvolution.h:612 annotates this class ios(10.0) and the release
// exports _OBJC_CLASS_$_MPSImageGaussianPyramid from 10.0.1, which tools/release-split.lua measures
// over the held ladder and agrees with, so 10.0 is what this object implements. Its superclass
// MPSImagePyramid is exported only from 16.0 and is MPSImagePyramid16.m's class; MPSImageConvolution.h
// annotates that one ios(10.0) too and the releases do not agree, which is written down where it is
// implemented. The three Laplacian pyramid classes annotate ios(10.0) as well and the ladder exports
// them from 12.0, so they are MPSImageLaplacianPyramid12.m's work. What the three objects share is in
// CharonMPSPyramid.h.
//
// THE FILTER is MPSImagePyramid's own and is reached through charon_mps_filter, which MPSImagePyramid16.m
// implements and every band that keeps this object also keeps, because the release exports this class
// from 10.0.1 and the base only from 16.0: a band keeps an object when the release does not export it, so
// a band that keeps this one is below 10.0.1 and therefore below 16.0.
//
// THE LEVEL SHAPE is the header's own (:508-514):
//     w_n = max(1, floor(w_0 / 2^n)),  h_n = max(1, floor(h_0 / 2^n))
//
// THE WALK (:519-537 and :576-596) fills every mipmap level after level 0, in place:
//     mip[n+1] = Downsample( filter( mip[n] ) )
// where Downsample "removes odd rows and columns from the input image" (:582-583) - which is to say
// level n+1's pixel (x, y) is the filtered level n at (2x, 2y). The header says the pyramid "ignores
// clipRect and offset and fills the entire mipmap levels" (:506-508), so nothing here reads either.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. No number in this file is a measurement of Apple's code - the release's own MPS
// crashes on this encode, which facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Elements10.md records with its
// transcript. What is written here is transcribed from the header above; what has been checked is the
// armv7 link, that this object defines the class it says.
