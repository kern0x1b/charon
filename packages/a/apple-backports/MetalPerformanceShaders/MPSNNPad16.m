// MPSNNPad, the one padding kernel of MPSNNReshape.h, from the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface.
//
// ONE OBJECT FOR ONE RELEASE, and the release is 16.0 rather than the 12.1 the header's own annotation
// reads (MPSNNReshape.h:225, MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING(macos(10.14.1), ios(12.1), macCatalyst(13.0),
// tvos(12.1))). What an object is placed by is the HELD ladder and not the header's clause, because the
// release the port deploys on has to be one a release's own export answers for, and no release is held
// between 12.0 and 16.0:
//
//   $ printf 'MPSNNPad\n' | python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py
//   MPSNNPad   16.0
//
// so this class is answered by a 16.0 object and could not sit beside the 12.0 states of
// MPSNNStates12.m without one file carrying two band points - which `misplaced()` in backports.lua refuses
// and tools/release-split.lua reports as MIXED-RELEASES. The row says 12.1, which is the header's own date
// and is left as it is; this comment is the placement, and the command above is what it rests on. The same
// measurement puts MPSCNNNormalizationMeanAndVarianceState and MPSRNNMatrixTrainingState at 12.0, which is
// why those two are in MPSNNStates12.m and this one is here.
//
// THE SUPERCLASS is carried: MPSNNReshape.h:227 makes MPSNNPad an MPSCNNKernel, and MPSCNNKernel10.m is
// that class. What MPSNNPad adds over it is the pad.
//
// WHAT IT IS, in the header's own words. paddingSizeBefore (:229-241) is the left, the top and the smaller
// feature-channel indices, paddingSizeAfter (:243-256) the other three ends, and the pad is filled either
// with one float (fillValue, "Determines the constant value to apply when using MPSImageEdgeModeConstant.
// Default: 0.0f", :258-263) or with one float per destination feature channel out of the NSData the
// designated initializer takes (:282-287). Which of the two is in force is the header's own rule at
// :260-262 - fillValue "is ignored if the filter is initialized with a per-channel fill value" - so an
// NSData present is what decides and the scalar is not consulted, which is why the encode below reads the
// array when there is one and the scalar when there is not.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CARRIED HERE. -destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages:sourceStates: is the method
// paddingSizeBefore exists for ("This property is used for automatically sizing the destination image for
// the function destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages:sourceStates:", :230-232); it is MPSCNNKernel's
// and belongs to the graph layer, which is the release-11 object, so this object carries the pad and the
// fill and leaves the sizing to whoever carries the graph.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. No number in this file is a measurement of Apple's code: the release's own MPS
// cannot run on this host, which facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Image9.md records with the selector and the
// text of the log. What has been checked is the armv7 build of this directory - every object compiles at
// -target armv7-apple-ios6.0 and `ld -r -undefined dynamic_lookup` over all of them leaves no MPS class
// undefined - and the commands are in facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Release12.md. No host case, no device
// run and no gate: the gate is the coordinator's.

// The simplest of the three: MPSCNNKernel's initializer and the header's two properties at their

//
// MPSNNReshape.h marks the four-argument form below a designated initializer of this class (:290-297),
// so this one is a SECONDARY initializer of it and must reach MPSCNNKernel's own initializer THROUGH it
// rather than by chaining to [super initWithDevice:] directly - which is what clang asks for at
// -Wobjc-designated-initializers, and what the two-argument form above already does. The state this
// leaves is the one MPSCNNKernel's initializer makes plus the three defaults, so it is the same object
// the direct chain built; no pragma is carried for the warning, because there is nothing left to warn
// about once the chain is the one the header's own initializer graph asks for.
