// WHAT IS HERE, and what is not, and why. The family is twelve rows. Four are delivered in this file: the
// base MPSImageConvolution and the three fixed-weight subclasses whose whole behaviour is a weighted sum -
// MPSImageBox (:146), MPSImageTent (:219) and MPSImageGaussianBlur (:237). The other eight are OWED and
// refused by name rather than answered wrongly, each listed at the bottom with the reason. Every one of
// them is a different kind of object from these four, not more of the same, which is why they are not
// half-written here.

//   ios(9.0) :146  MPSImageBox : MPSUnaryImageKernel, readonly kernelWidth (:154) / kernelHeight (:152),

//                      number", and -initWithDevice: NS_UNAVAILABLE (:185)

//
// THE ONE THING TO GET RIGHT. MPSImageConvolution.h:62-72 on bias: "The bias is a value to be added to
// convolved pixel before it is converted back to the storage format." So the order is sum, then add the
// bias, then store. Adding the bias after the store would be a different kernel, and one whose answer
// differs in the last ulp on every pixel.
//
// The edge rule is inherited rather than this header's: MPSUnaryImageKernel's edgeMode, whose default
// MPSImageKernel.h gives as "usually MPSImageEdgeModeZero". A window reaching off the edge contributes
// ZERO. Replicating the border instead would be MPSImageEdgeModeClamp and would be a different answer, so
// this is edgeMode-aware and only Zero is implemented here; a caller that asks for Clamp or Mirror is
// refused by name rather than given a Zero answer it did not ask for.
//
// Accumulation is in double and the store is float32, so the answer is within one float32 ulp of the exact
// sum. That is what the harness's reference compares against, and it is stated here because claiming
// exactness would be false - the reduce family's sums were compared for equality until the differential
// caught 2.8499999 against 2.85.
