// MPSImagePyramid, the base class "for creating different kinds of pyramid images"
// (MPSImageConvolution.h:495), from the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface of MPSImageConvolution.h.
//
// One object for one release, and the release's own measurement is the judge rather than the header's
// annotation. MPSImageConvolution.h:519 annotates this class ios(10.0), and the registry's
// sdk-26.2-surface.tsv carries 10.0 for it, so this object's registry rows keep `introduced` at what
// the SDK declares. But the release does not EXPORT it until 16.0, and an object's placement is
// decided by what a client can bind, not by whether the name is in the cache:
//
//   * tools/cache-index/first-rung.py answers 10.0.1 for _OBJC_CLASS_$_MPSImagePyramid, and that is
//     TRUE and not the question: first-rung measures whether a rung CARRIES a name, and this one
//     carries it from 10.0.1 because MPSImageGaussianPyramid's super_class points at it.
//   * tools/release-split.lua measures what a rung EXPORTS, and answers 16.0 - which is what
//     modules/apple/backports.lua's band() places an object by, and what makes an object carrying
//     this class and MPSImageGaussianPyramid (10.0.1) a file that band() refuses with "an object
//     carries API that arrived in one release, so split it". Both run over the held ladder and agree.
//
// MEASURED over the held armv7/armv7s ladder, the MPS* names each rung's export trie carries that
// contain "Pyramid": 10.0.1 and 11.0 export MPSImageGaussianPyramid and no MPSImagePyramid; 12.0 adds
// MPSImageLaplacianPyramid, +Add and +Subtract and still no MPSImagePyramid; 16.0 adds
// _OBJC_CLASS_$_MPSImagePyramid and _OBJC_METACLASS_$_MPSImagePyramid. So the kernels over this class
// are exported BEFORE it, which is why MPSImagePyramid10.m and MPSImageLaplacianPyramid12.m can both
// read the filter this object publishes and neither needs to ask whether it is there: a band keeps an
// object exactly when the release does not export it, so a band that keeps either kernel - below 10.0.1
// and below 12.0 respectively - is below 16.0 and keeps this one too. What the three objects share is in
// CharonMPSPyramid.h.
//
// AND THE NAME IS AN ALIAS, because from 10.0.1 the release carries this class without exporting it,
// which is the window MPSImagePyramid10.m's own comment above describes: carried from 10.0.1 (measured
// with apple.objc.inventory over the armv7s caches of 10.0.1, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.3.4 - superclass
// MPSUnaryImageKernel, seven own methods: -initWithDevice:, -initWithDevice:centerWeight:,
// -initWithDevice:kernelWidth:kernelHeight:weights:, -kernelWidth, -kernelHeight, -dealloc and
// -copyWithZone:device:) and exported by no image of any of them, measured with apple.dyld over the
// same caches' export tries; 11.0 (arm64) carries it in MPSImage.framework and still exports no
// symbol). So a band of 10.0.1 to 10.3.4 that linked a class implementation of this name held two
// classes of one name in every process, and the runtime keeps the one it registered first. The name
// goes through charon_alias.h, which is what modules/apple/backports.lua's own check_categories asks
// for when it reads this reading ("the release carries MPSImagePyramid in MetalPerformanceShaders
// without exporting it: alias it through charon_alias.h") and what MDLMeshBufferZoneDefault,
// HKCDADocument, NSTextList and NSTextTab already are for the same one.
//
// What that costs this file, measured over the same caches and read out of attach.c:
//
//   * On a band below 10.0.1 the release has no class of this name at all, the proxy IS the class, and
//     every member below answers out of the state beside it - which is what MPSImagePyramid10.m's
//     Gaussian kernel and MPSImageLaplacianPyramid12.m's two inherit and read.
//   * On 10.0.1 to 10.3.4 the release's class is found, the proxy is re-parented under it, and
//     attach.c's charon_adopt_methods REPLACES the proxy's own copy of every member the release's class
//     already has - which here is all five of them (the list above). So on those bands a subclass of
//     ours that a program constructs gets the RELEASE's initializers, and the filter's weights are then
//     in the release's own private storage, which no header declares and which this port therefore
//     cannot read. MPSImageLaplacianPyramid12.m's two kernels read the weights through
//     -charon_mps_filter, and they refuse there with that reason rather than reading weights this port
//     never wrote. MPSImagePyramid10.m's Gaussian is not in those bands at all: the release exports
//     MPSImageGaussianPyramid from 10.0.1, so band() reexports that object there.
//   * From 16.0 the release exports the name and the band links neither this object nor the proxy. No
//     band of this machine reaches 16.0: the armv7 ladder ends at 9.3.6 and armv7s at 10.3.4.
//
// THE FILTER, which every pyramid here uses and which the header gives three ways.
//   the default (MPSImageConvolution.h:505-506)  "The filter kernel is the outer product of
//     w = [ 1/16,  1/4,  3/8,  1/4,  1/16 ]^T, with itself"
//   by a centre weight (:527-528)  "the outer product ww^T, where
//     w = [ (1/4 - a/2),  1/4,  a,  1/4,  (1/4 - a/2) ]^T"
//   or the caller's own (:548-552, row major, kernelWidth * kernelHeight values)
// The kernel must be odd in both directions (:562-569), and that is refused by name rather than
// answered with a filter the header does not describe.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. No number in this file is a measurement of Apple's code - the release's own MPS
// crashes on this family's encode, which facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Elements10.md records with its
// transcript. What is written here is transcribed from the header above; what has been checked is the
// armv7 link, that this object defines the class it says.

// NSMutableData and two integers rather than the three ivars this object used to have, and the three
