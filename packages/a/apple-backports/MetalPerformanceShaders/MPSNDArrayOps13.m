// The three NDArray kernels of iOS 13 that declare arithmetic: MPSNDArrayGather and its gradient,
// MPSNDArrayStridedSlice and its gradient, and MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication. From
// MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayGather.h, MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayStridedSlice.h and
// MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication.h in the SDK of iOS 16.4.
//
// These are the three classes of the family whose bodies are specified well enough to write from the
// header, and each one's loop below is the header's own wording rather than a paraphrase of it:
//
//   MPSNDArrayGather (MPSNDArrayGather.h:39-46): "For each dimension other than axis
//       result[i] = source[i]; 0 <= i < array slice length along dimension. Along the specified axis
//       result[i] = source[indices[i]]; 0 <= i < number of indices." So the result has the source's
//       shape on every axis but the gather's, and on the gather's axis it has as many elements as
//       there are indices - which is the one place the result is NOT the source's shape, and an
//       implementation that kept the source's length there would answer a different question.
//
//   MPSNDArrayStridedSlice (MPSNDArrayStridedSlice.h:20-21): "Extracts a subset of the source array
//       using the specified slice strides." A stride of s in a dimension of length n therefore holds
//       ceil(n/s) elements taken at 0, s, 2s, ... - the count is a CEILING, not a division, which is
//       what makes a dimension of 5 with a stride of 2 hold three and not two.
//
//   MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication (MPSNDArrayMatrixMultiplication.h:33-37): "D = alpha * A * B +
//       beta * C ... A, B, C, and D are matrices which are represented by objects stored in the two
//       most major dimensions of the MPSNDArray ... If an input's 3rd or 4th dimension is 1 its data
//       will be broadcast as appropriate to the remaining input's 3rd or 4th dimension
//       respectively." So a 4-D array is a BATCH of 2-D matrices, dimension 2 and 3 being the batch
//       and the matrices' two most major dimensions, and a 1 there broadcasts.
//
// The two gradients are the reverse of their forward passes and are the reason the state exists: a
// gather's gradient SCATTER-ACCUMULATES the incoming gradient into the rows the forward pass read, and
// a strided slice's scatter-accumulates it into the positions it read. A scatter-accumulate and not a
// scatter, because two indices of a gather may name the same row and the gradient of that row is the
// SUM of the two - which is what makes a gather with repeated indices answer something at all.
//
// Every one of these encodes into a command buffer, so -CharonMPSCommandBufferPermits is the gate
// MPSNDArray13.m's own comment describes: the port's kernels are synchronous and the result is in the
// destination when the encode RETURNS, which is at least as strong as the release's own contract.

// The state's recorded axis, a method on a class the port DEFINES and therefore its own machinery
