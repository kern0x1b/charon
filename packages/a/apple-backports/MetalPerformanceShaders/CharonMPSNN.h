// CharonMPSNN.h - the edges the graph's nodes share, under names of their own.
//
// Nothing here is a name an SDK header declares. The release reaches a node's sources, a node's kernel
// and a node's result through its own internal tables, and a graph in this port needs the same three edges
// under names of its own; MPSNNPadding is the one exception and it is a real protocol, declared by
// MPSNeuralNetworkTypes.h and CONFORMED to by MPSNNDefaultPadding, which is what emits its metadata.
//
// Every selector is prefixed, so a class the release also carries is not shadowed, and every function is
// static, so no backport file depends on another one's symbols - the same rule CharonMPSImage.h:6-8 gives
// and the same reason: a file whose exports a band's release already has is left out of that band, so a
// shared C function defined in a file that implements a class is an undefined symbol in later bands only.
//
// THE THREE FILES THIS HEADER IS SPREAD ACROSS, and why there are three:
//
//   MPSNNGraph11.m        MPSNNGraph and the ten classes the export ladder places at 11.0
//   MPSNNFilterNode12.m   MPSNNFilterNode, at 12.0
//   MPSNNGraphNodes16.m   MPSNNStateNode, MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode and MPSCNNPoolingNode, at 16.0
//
// The split is by what a client can BIND, which is what backports.lua's measured_names()/releases_in()
// measure and what tools/cache-index/first-rung.py does not: a class can be present in a release's ObjC
// inventory and its class symbol still in no export trie of that release, and a client cannot link against
// what is not exported. Measured with dyld.load + dyld.exported_at over the held ladder, armv7 preferred,
// and the placement is the EARLIEST of the class symbol and the metaclass symbol, which is what
// backports.lua:2368-2377 does:
//
//   11.0  MPSNNGraph MPSNNImageNode MPSNNDefaultPadding MPSNNAdditionNode MPSNNSubtractionNode
//         MPSNNMultiplicationNode MPSNNDivisionNode MPSNNConcatenationNode MPSCNNPoolingAverageNode
//         MPSCNNPoolingMaxNode
//   12.0  MPSNNFilterNode
//   16.0  MPSNNStateNode MPSNNBinaryArithmeticNode MPSCNNPoolingNode
//
// All fourteen agree on class and metaclass, so the earliest is the class's own.
//
// MPSNNFilterNode is the SUPERCLASS of seven of the other thirteen and lands in a LATER object than they
// do, which reads backwards and is Apple's own export history: the base is exported by no image until
// 12.0 and its subclasses from 11.0. That is fine here and it is not a hierarchy built at runtime: the
// subclasses reference the base as a link-time symbol, and a band that keeps the 11.0 object also keeps
// the 12.0 and 16.0 ones, so the reference resolves in the same dylib. It is the same way main's other MPS
// objects already reference CharonMPS classes across files.

// THE PADDING ARITHMETIC IS THE HEADER'S OWN, NOT A GUESS. MPSNeuralNetworkTypes.h:379-431 gives the two

// pixel, and the pooling table in Cnn.md is measured in whole pixels. The host case extracts that C block
