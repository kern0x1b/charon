// MPSImageLaplacianPyramid and the two kernels over it, from MPSImageConvolution.h of the iPhoneOS 16.4
// surface: the base with its two pointwise parameters, and the subtract and the add pyramid.
//
// One object for one release, and the release's own cache ladder is the judge rather than the header's
// annotation. All three annotate ios(10.0) - MPSImageConvolution.h:663 (:664 MPSImageLaplacianPyramid),
// :683 (:684 MPSImageLaplacianPyramidSubtract) and :706 (:707 MPSImageLaplacianPyramidAdd) - and
//     python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py _OBJC_CLASS_\$_MPSImageLaplacianPyramid
//         _OBJC_CLASS_\$_MPSImageLaplacianPyramidAdd _OBJC_CLASS_\$_MPSImageLaplacianPyramidSubtract
// answers 12.0 for all three, where the same command answers 10.0.1 for MPSImagePyramid and
// MPSImageGaussianPyramid, which are MPSImagePyramid10.m's classes. So 12.0 is what this object
// implements, and it is why these three are not in that file: one object carries one release. What the two
// files share - the level shape, the level read and write, and the filter's own accessors - is in
// CharonMPSPyramid.h.
//
// THE LAPLACIAN PYRAMID (:612-660) is the difference against an interpolated half-resolution level:
//     LaplacianMipLevel[l] := GaussianMipLevel[l] - Interpolate(GaussianMipLevel[l+1])
// where Interpolate is "the classical 2x signal interpolation procedure" (:619-620), which the header
// then spells out as exactly two steps (:622-633): zero-stuffing, "dst.at(x, y) := src.at(x, y) if
// even(x) and even(y) else 0", and then filtering with this class's inherited kernel. So the
// interpolation here is a five-by-five filter over the zero-stuffed source, and a tap that lands on an odd
// position reads the zero of the zero-stuffing - which is also what settles the border, and it is why no
// edge mode is read here and none is asked for.
//
// The result is then mapped pointwise (:645-649): LaplacianRangeScale(pixel, bias, scale) =
// bias + pixel * scale, defaults bias 0.0 and scale 1.0. The subtract kernel (:683-704) writes it into
// every destination level from the bottom up, one fewer level than the source has; the add kernel
// (:706-729) inverts that mapping and adds the interpolated level back, walking down from the top and
// taking the level above the first iteration from the source, which the header calls "the
// LaplacianMipLevel[#top] level" (:722-725).
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. No number in this file is a measurement of Apple's code - the release's own MPS
// crashes on this family's substrate, which facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Elements10.md records with its
// transcript. What is written here is transcribed from the header above; what has been checked is the
// armv7 link, that this object defines the three classes it says.

#import "CharonMPSPyramid.h"

// The interpolation, which is the same filter over the ZERO-STUFFED source: at (x, y) the sample a tap
// reads is the source's own at (p / 2, q / 2) when the tap's own position (p, q) is even in both
// directions, and zero otherwise. That is MPSImageConvolution.h:625-626 verbatim, and it is what makes
// the border answer without an edge rule of any kind.
