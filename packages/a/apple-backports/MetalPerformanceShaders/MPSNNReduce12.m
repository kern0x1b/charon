// The twelve concrete MPSNNReduce classes, from MPSNNReduce.h of the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface. The
// release exports these from iOS 12.0, and the abstract base MPSNNReduceUnary they inherit from only
// from iOS 16.0, so they are their own object apart from MPSNNReduce16.m. Each differs from the base
// only in the axis and the operation, which is exactly what MPSNNReduce.h's twelve per-class sentences
// describe.
//
// Every header annotation here says ios(11.3) - MPSNNReduce.h:68, :95, :121, :175, :201, :227, :281,
// :307, :333, :359, :385, :412, each repeating the MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING above the base at :36 -
// and `introduced` in the registry says 11.3 for all twelve, and both are right about when APPLE
// published them. What an OBJECT is placed at is the first held release that EXPORTS the symbol, and the
// two answers differ: measured with modules/apple/dyld.lua's first_releases() over the held ladder, the
// call modules/apple/backports.lua's check_releases() makes, the twelve classes' class symbols are
// exported by the 12.0, 16.0 and 18.0 caches and by no earlier held one, so first_releases() answers
// 12.0. tools/cache-index/first-rung.py answers 12.0 for them as well, and the two tools part company on
// the BASE rather than on these: the 12.0 cache carries MPSNNReduceUnary's name and does not export it,
// so the base reads as 16.0 and these as 12.0, and an object cannot be both.
//
// There is no arithmetic here: the walk is the base's, reached through the `charon_` seam
// CharonMPSReduce.h declares, which is the same seam MPSImageReduce12.m uses for the MPSImageReduce
// classes, because a class that declares no encode of its own - which the release's own cache says of
// all twelve - cannot carry one.

#import "CharonMPSReduce.h"

// One scoped suppression, and it is the same one MPSNNReduce16.m carries and the same one recorded in
// coordination/crutches.md, moved with the code it covers. Each of the twelve classes above declares
// -initWithCoder:device: (MPSNNReduce.h:85 and its eleven siblings) and none of them implements it: the
// coder cannot say which of the four operations to build over which axis, so the base's
// -initWithCoder:device: is the one that reads it, and MPSNNReduce16.m implements it there.
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wincomplete-implementation"

// See MPSNNReduce16.m for why: each concrete class's -initWithDevice: is NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER and
// the base's only designated initializer cannot know which operation to build. Recorded in
// coordination/crutches.md.
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wobjc-designated-initializers"

// The ONE class whose OWN @interface declares `weight` - MPSNNReduce.h:420, on
// MPSNNReduceFeatureChannelsSum - gets its accessors implemented against the base's storage, because
// the SDK's declaration makes it autosynthesize an ivar of its own that the walk does not read.
//
// ONE class and not two, measured rather than assumed: the header gives `weight` to
// MPSNNReduceFeatureChannelsSum alone (:413-420), and the release's own cache agrees - of the twelve
// concrete classes, only MPSNNReduceFeatureChannelsSum lists -weight and -setWeight:.
// MPSNNReduceFeatureChannelsMean (:334) declares no property at all, and its cache entry lists no
// weight selector, so a `weight` on it would be an API this port has and the release does not.
