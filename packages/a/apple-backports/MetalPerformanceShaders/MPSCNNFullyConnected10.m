// MPSCNNFullyConnected, from MPSCNNConvolution.h of the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface: the class the header
// calls "a fully connected convolution layer a.k.a. Inner product" (:1314).
//
// One object for one release: the class's own annotation above its @interface is ios(10.0)
// (MPSCNNConvolution.h:1319) and nothing else is in this file.
//
// WHAT THE CLASS IS FOR, in the header's own words, and why this file is short. A fully connected layer
// is "a convolution with a kernel that spans the whole of the input" (:1316-1324): the class exists so
// that a caller can name the layer it means, and the header says the arithmetic is a convolution -
// "The optimized convolution filter used by MPSImageLaplacian can also be used by creating a
// MPSImageConvolution object" says the same thing about MPSImageConvolution (MPSImageConvolution.h:
// :115-117), and MPSCNNFullyConnected's own discussion says a convolution with kernelWidth and
// kernelHeight of the input's own shape does the same work "However, using the MPSCNNFullyConnected for
// this is better for performance as it lets us choose the most [efficient kernel]" (:1338).
//
// So the walk is MPSCNNConvolution's, which MPSCNNConvolution10.m carries and which is this class's
// superclass - there is no second convolution in this file, and a second one would be a second answer
// to keep in step. What this file adds is the class and the one initializer the class has at 10.0,
// which is the deprecated form MPSCNNConvolution.h:1376-1382 annotates
// MPS_AVAILABLE_STARTING_BUT_DEPRECATED(ios(10.0, 11.0)): the raw float arrays.
//
// The later -initWithDevice:weights: (:1355, ios(11.0)) and -initWithCoder:device: (:1395, ios(11.0))
// are not carried here: they are 11.0 members of an 11.0 surface, this object is a 10.0 one, and
// MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource has no implementation in this package for the first of them to name.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. No number in this file is a measurement of Apple's code. What has been checked
// here is the armv7 link, that this object defines the class it says.
