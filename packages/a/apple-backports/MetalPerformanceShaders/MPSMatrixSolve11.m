// MPSMatrixSolveTriangular, MPSMatrixSolveLU, MPSMatrixSolveCholesky, MPSMatrixDecompositionLU and
// MPSMatrixDecompositionCholesky, from MPSMatrixSolve.h and MPSMatrixDecomposition.h of the iPhoneOS
// 16.4 surface. One object for one release: each of the five carries
// MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING(macos(10.13), ios(11.0), macCatalyst(13.0), tvos(11.0)) above its own
// declaration (MPSMatrixSolve.h:32, :132, MPSMatrixDecomposition.h:63, :147 and the Cholesky solve at
// MPSMatrixSolve.h), so every @implementation below is a release-11.0 class and nothing else is.
//
// What decides that this is a CPU walk and not an opaque encoder call is the RELEASE'S OWN CACHE, read
// with tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over $HOME/.charon/dyld/16.0/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e: the two
// solves' and the two decompositions' encodes are the only thing they declare beyond their
// initializers, and every one of them takes MPSMatrix and MPSMatrix objects - no MTLComputeCommandEncoder,
// no dispatch, nothing this host would have to encode to reach. The arithmetic they name is the
// arithmetic a CPU already does: a triangular substitution, an LU solve against a factorization, a
// Cholesky factorization, a Cholesky solve. MPSMatrixUnaryKernel and MPSMatrixBinaryKernel are classes
// this port already carries (matrix.json, introduced 11.0, implemented), and MPSMatrixVectorMultiplication11.m
// already walks a matrix with CharonMPSMatrixViewOf / CharonMPSMatrixElement / CharonMPSLoad /
// CharonMPSStore - this file reuses that substrate rather than writing a second answer for the same walk.
//
// What the header fixes, and what it does not:
//
//   - The systems each kernel solves. MPSMatrixSolve.h:24-26 "op(A) * X = alpha * B or X * op(A) = alpha
//     * B. Where A is either upper or lower triangular and op(A) is A**T or A. B is the array of right
//     hand sides for which the equations are to be solved. X is the resulting matrix of solutions."
//     MPSMatrixSolve.h:127-129 the same for the LU solve, "op(A) * X = B". So a triangular solve is a
//     forward or a backward substitution over one triangle, and op() is the choice of triangle and of
//     transposition - which is what MPSMatrixBinaryKernel's `transpose` property already carries.
//   - The two factorizations. MPSMatrixDecomposition.h:138-143 "A = L * L**T or A = U**T * U. A is a
//     symmetric positive-definite matrix for which the factorization is to be computed. L and U are
//     lower and upper triangular matrices respectively." So the Cholesky is of a POSITIVE-DEFINITE
//     matrix and the two forms are the same factorization written for the lower or the upper triangle,
//     which is the header's own `lower` parameter (:155).
//   - The statuses. MPSMatrixDecomposition.h:37-40 names four, and their VALUES are the header's own:
//     Success = 0, Failure = -1, Singular = -2, NonPositiveDefinite = -3. A factorization that meets a
//     pivot of zero answers Singular and a Cholesky that meets a non-positive pivot answers
//     NonPositiveDefinite, rather than dividing by it - which is the difference between a status and a
//     number full of infinities, and the cases below measure both.
//
// What the header does NOT state, and what no measurement on this host can supply: how the release
// PICKS the pivot in an LU, and therefore the pivot values themselves. The header says
// MPSMatrixDecomposition.h:92-94 that pivotIndices must hold "an array of size 1xmin(rows, columns)
// values. Element type must be MPSDataTypeUInt32" and nothing about which row is chosen. Partial pivoting
// - the largest absolute value in the column - is the standard choice and is what this file uses, and it
// is recorded in the rows below as this file's choice and not as a measurement of the release's pivots.
// The factorization of a matrix whose LU factors are unique up to those pivots IS pinned: L's and U's
// values are the same whichever pivot rule is used, only the ORDER of the rows and the pivot indices
// move, and the cases below check the factors rather than the indices for that reason.
//
// Arithmetic: a triangular substitution and an LU solve on values the caller chose are sums and
// quotients, and each is taken in double. A factorization of a matrix whose entries are exactly
// representable and whose factors are too is EXACT, and the differential compares the factors for
// EQUALITY. A division cannot be exact in binary, so a solve's answers are held to one whole float32 ulp
// - the bound MPSImageStatistics11.m and the reduce families already state, not widened here.
