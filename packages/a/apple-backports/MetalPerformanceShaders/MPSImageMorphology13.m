// MPSImageMorphology, from MPSImageMorphology.h of the iPhoneOS 26.2 surface. One object per release:
// every class in this file is MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING ios(9.0) (:21, :71, :95, :173).
//
// Four classes, and all four are the same thing with two choices in it: the maximum or the minimum over a
// window centred on each pixel.
//
//   :17-18 MPSImageAreaMax : MPSUnaryImageKernel - "finds the maximum pixel value in a rectangular region
//        centered around each pixel in the source image. If there are multiple channels in the source
//        image, each channel is processed in..." - so the window is rectangular and centred, and each
//        channel is reduced on its own.
//   :72 MPSImageAreaMin : MPSImageAreaMax - the minimum over the same window.
//   :94 MPSImageDilate : MPSUnaryImageKernel - the maximum over the same window, but with the caller's probe:
//        :129 -initWithDevice:kernelHeight:kernelWidth:values: takes "values The set of values to use as
//        the dilate probe", and :116 "Each dilate shape probe defines a 3D surface of values", so the probe
//        is a height per tap and the result is the maximum of source plus probe.
//   :174 MPSImageErode : MPSImageDilate - the minimum over the same probe.
//
// THE EDGE IS CLAMPED HERE, and that is the one fact that makes this family unlike the convolution's:
// :69 and :93 both say "The edgeMode property is assumed to always be MPSImageEdgeModeClamp for this filter."
// So a window reaching off the edge REPLICATES the border rather than reading zero, and this file clamps
// rather than multiplying by zero. Getting that wrong would be invisible on an interior pixel and wrong on
// every edge pixel, which is why the case runs a window wider than the image on purpose.
//
// The odd-dimension rule is stated at :117-119 for Dilate's kernelWidth and kernelHeight and is applied
// here to both pairs of classes, since a window that is not odd has no centre pixel to sit on and the
// header calls the window "centered around each pixel" (:17).
//
// EXACT, and compared exactly. A maximum and a minimum SELECT a value the source already holds - nothing
// is added and nothing is multiplied - so the answer is bit-for-bit one of the inputs and a tolerance would
// hide a real defect rather than absorb a rounding. That is the opposite of the convolution family, which
// accumulates in double and stores float32 and so carries one ulp, and the reference states which of the
// two it is doing.

// Which of the two, and the probe. AreaMax and AreaMin are Dilate and Erode with a probe of all ones, so
