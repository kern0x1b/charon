// The NDArray kernel base classes of iOS 13: MPSNDArrayMultiaryBase and the three that descend from
// it, the unary and binary specialisations of each, and MPSNDArrayGradientState. From
// MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayKernel.h and MPSNDArray/MPSNDArrayGradientState.h in the SDK of iOS 16.4.
//
// WHAT THESE CLASSES ARE, which is what makes them real rather than declarations. Every one of them
// is ABSTRACT in the release - MPSNDArrayMultiaryBase:92-104 declares offsetsAtSourceIndex:,
// edgeModeAtSourceIndex:, kernelSizesForSourceIndex:, stridesForSourceIndex: and
// dilationRatesForSourceIndex: and no arithmetic at all, and MPSNDArrayMultiaryKernel's encodes take
// "the list of sources for the filter in a NSArray. Ordering to be defined by subclass". So the
// arithmetic belongs to a subclass and the classes here own the three things every subclass needs and
// none of them re-implements:
//
//   - the FILTER, per source: the offsets, the kernel sizes, the strides, the dilation rates and the
//     edge mode, with the defaults the header states. MPSNDArrayUnaryKernel's own comment gives the
//     offsets' default as "0,0,0...", the kernelSizes' as 1, the strides' as 1 and the edgeMode's as
//     "MPSImageEdgeModeZero" (MPSNDArrayKernel.h:227-266); MPSNDArrayBinaryKernel repeats all five
//     for a primary and a secondary source (:389-470). Those are stored once, here, and read back
//     through the accessors both spellings have - the plural one on the base and the singular one on
//     the unary and binary forms.
//   - the DESTINATION, which -destinationArrayDescriptorForSourceArrays:sourceState: and
//     -resultStateForSourceArrays:sourceStates:destinationArray: answer. The header is explicit that
//     the object's own properties must already be configured "as if the -encode call was about to be
//     made, before this method is called. Those properties may affect the results"
//     (MPSNDArrayKernel.h:150-157), so the descriptor is built from them and not from the sources
//     alone.
//   - the ENCODE PLUMBING: taking each source into a host buffer, writing the destination back, and
//     the read-count bookkeeping, in one place, so a subclass writes its arithmetic and nothing else.
//
// WHAT A SUBCLASS WRITES is the loop, and the three concrete kernels in MPSNDArrayOps13.m are the
// three that have one. A subclass that does not override the walk is a class the release also has no
// arithmetic for, and its encode refuses and says which class it was rather than writing a number
// nothing computed - which is the same shape MPSMatrixMultiplication10.m's -initWithDevice: takes.
