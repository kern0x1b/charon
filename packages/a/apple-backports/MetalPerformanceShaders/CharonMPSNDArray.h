// CharonMPSNDArray.h - the addressing an MPSNDArray and the NDArray kernels share.
//
// Every function here is static, so no backport file depends on another one's symbols: a band that
// leaves a file out does not leave the others with undefined ones. CharonMPS.h's own note says the
// same for the matrix family, and the reason is mechanical: the band machinery keeps an object whole
// or drops it whole, so a C function defined in a file that also exports a class is undefined in
// every band that object is not carried in.
//
// WHAT AN NDARRAY IS HERE, and why a kernel reads it into a host buffer first. MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h
// has no accessor for an array's bytes: the release's own way in and out is
// -readBytes:strideBytes: and -writeBytes:strideBytes: (MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h:383 and :397), and with
// a nil stride array they pack the copy with "no additional space in between elements, rows, etc".
// So a kernel below materializes each source into a packed host buffer through that method, does its
// arithmetic there, and writes the destination back through the other. That is the release's own
// route to the data, not a seam invented for the port, and it is what a view forces: a transposed or
// sliced array is a VIEW, recorded rather than performed (MPSCore/MPSNDArray.h's class discussion),
// so its elements are not adjacent in memory and there is no single pointer to walk.
//
// The class discussion is also what fixes the ORDER every walk below uses: the major row, "the
// dimension in which successive elements appear adjacent to one another in memory", is the 0th, and
// the dimensions after it are a densely packed array of rows. So a packed host buffer is indexed
// with dim 0 the fastest running, and MPSNDArray.h's own initialisers agree - the dimensionSizes
// array "goes from fastest moving to slowest moving dimension".
