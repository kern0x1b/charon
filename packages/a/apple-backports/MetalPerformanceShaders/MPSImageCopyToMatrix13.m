// MPSImageCopyToMatrix, from the header of the SDK of iOS 16.4, in
// MetalPerformanceShaders.framework/Frameworks/MPSImage.framework/Headers/MPSImageCopy.h:18-80. One
// object per release: the band machinery keeps an object whole or drops it whole, so a file here carries
// the API of exactly one release.
//
// The header, at :19-24: "The MPSImageCopyToMatrix copies image data to a MPSMatrix. The image data is
// stored in a row of a matrix. The dataLayout specifies the order in which the feature channels in the
// MPSImage get stored in the matrix. If MPSImage stores a batch of images, the images are copied into
// multiple rows, one row per image."
//
// So one image becomes one row of the destination matrix, and dataLayout is what decides the order
// inside that row. MPSImage.h:300-303 gives the two orders, as the surface's own comments:
// MPSDataLayoutFeatureChannelsxHeightxWidth is [imageNum][featureChannels][imageHeight][imageWidth] and
// MPSDataLayoutHeightxWidthxFeatureChannels is [imageNum][imageHeight][imageWidth][featureChannels]. The
// header's default, at MPSImageCopy.h:37, is MPSDataLayoutFeatureChannelsxHeightxWidth, and that is what
// -initWithDevice: is given when the caller does not say.
//
// Two things bound the copy, and both are the header's:
//   - :23-24 "The origin, relative to [0, 0] in the destination matrix, at which to start writing
//     results", defaulting to [0, 0], with "The z value must be 0". The origin's x is the row the first
//     image is written to and its y the column that row starts at, which is how :89 reads it for the
//     batch form: "Each image will be copied to its own row in the matrix, starting with row
//     destinationMatrixOrigin.x".
//   - :26-29 "The number of elements in a row in the matrix must be >= image width * image height *
//     number of featureChannels in the image." That is a requirement on the caller, and a kernel in
//     this port does not walk off the end of a buffer to find out: CharonMPSMatrixHolds asks it first and
//     the kernel says so in the log and writes nothing.
//
// The data type: MPSImageCopy.h:70 and :91 both say the destination matrix's dataType "must match the
// feature channel data type in sourceImage". A copy moves the bits, so a mismatch is refused rather than
// converted - there is no conversion in this kernel and a reinterpreting one would be a different
// kernel.
