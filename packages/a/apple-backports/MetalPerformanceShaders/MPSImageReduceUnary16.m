// MPSImageReduce, from MPSImageReduce.h of the iPhoneOS 26.2 surface. One object per release:
// MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING at :28 is macos(10.13.4), ios(11.3), so this is a release-11.3 object.
//
// Nine classes, eight of them concrete. :17-26 lists the eight operations - reduce row min, column min,
// row max, column max, row mean, column mean, row sum, column sum - and each concrete class says what it
// returns: :53 and its seven siblings "the mininmum value for each row of an image" (the release's own
// spelling), "the maximum value for each row", "the mean value for each row", "the sum for each row",
// and the same four for each column. So a row reduction answers one value per source row and a column
// reduction one per source column, and THAT is the permutation: the walk is over the reduction's axis.
//
// TWO RULES HERE ARE NOT LIKE EVERY OTHER UNARY KERNEL IN THIS PACKAGE, and both come from the header:
//
//  1. clipRectSource (:31-42) - "The source rectangle to use when reading data. If the clipRectSource does
//     not lie completely within the source image, the intersection of the image bounds and clipRectSource
//     will be used. The clipRectSource replaces the MPSUnaryImageKernel offset parameter for this filter.
//     The latter is ignored. Default: MPSRectNoClip, use the entire source texture."
//     So `offset` does not enter this kernel at all, and the window is an INTERSECTION with the image
//     rather than a rectangle applied on its own. That intersection is done here with the same resolved
//     region the walk uses, so the MPSRectNoClip sentinel is resolved against the image before any
//     texture sees it - a NoClip rectangle has size {-1,-1,0} and to a texture its xoffset + width is -2,
//     where the framework asserts.
//  2. clipRect is NOT the read window (:38-40) - "The clipRect specified in MPSUnaryImageKernel is used to
//     control the origin in the destination texture where the min, max values are written. The
//     clipRect.width must be >=2. The clipRect.height must be >= 1." So clipRect says where the result
//     lands in the destination, and those two lower bounds are preconditions. A clip that fails them is
//     refused by name and writes nothing, rather than being quietly widened or clipped away.
//
// The base's -initWithDevice: is NS_UNAVAILABLE (:44-47): "You must use one of the sub-classes of
// MPSImageReduceUnary." So instantiating the abstract base refuses and says so.
//
// The encode is implemented HERE, in the base's own @implementation, and not in a subclass. The earlier
// plan was a CATEGORY on MPSImageReduceUnary because MPSImageThreshold13.m carries a category on
// MPSUnaryImageKernel that implements the same selector - and that is true and still the reason the walk
// must not be inherited: the threshold band's walk is 1:1 and a reduction's destination is a different
// shape from its source, so the inherited one would be wrong. A category cannot read the ivars declared
// in the class's @implementation, though, and this kernel needs to remember which axis and which
// operation it is. So the encode lives in the base, where those two pieces of state are, and the
// concrete classes set them through one internal method.
//
// Arithmetic: min, max and sum select or add values the source already holds, so they are exact - a copy
// that moved a bit is a copy that moved a bit. mean divides, and dividing cannot be exact in binary, so
// the sum is taken in double and divided once, which leaves the result within one float32 ulp. The
// harness's reference uses that same bound, and states it.

#import "CharonMPSReduce.h"

#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wincomplete-implementation"
// ONE scoped suppression, and it is recorded in coordination/crutches.md with the reason. The SDK marks
// MPSImageReduceUnary's -initWithDevice: NS_UNAVAILABLE (:44-47) and each concrete class's -initWithDevice:
// NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER, so clang requires the latter to call a designated initializer of the former
// while the former's only designated initializer is -initWithCoder:device:, which cannot know which of the
// eight operations to build and takes a nonnull coder this path has no use for. Marking this file's own
// charon_initWithDevice:... designated was tried first and removed the concrete classes' warning but not
// the base's, because the base's -initWithDevice: then becomes a convenience initializer that refuses
// rather than one that calls self. Measured release behaviour, mirrored here: the release asserts
// ("Cannot directly initialize MPSImageReduceUnary") and aborts, so there is no successful chain to write.
