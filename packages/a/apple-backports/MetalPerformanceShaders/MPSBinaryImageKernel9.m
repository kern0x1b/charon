// MPSBinaryImageKernel, from MPSImageKernel.h:344-345 of the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface. One object per
// release: MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING at :344 says ios(9.0), and the registry row says introduced
// 9.0, so this is a release-9 object and the file is named for that.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is the same reason as MPSUnaryImageKernel9.m and for the same reason it
// is not a duplicate of it: the release declares MPSImageArithmetic over this class
// (MPSImageMath.h), so the arithmetic kernels' own hierarchy names it, and nothing in this package
// defined it. Measured over every armv7 object before this file:
//
//   U _OBJC_CLASS_$_MPSBinaryImageKernel     (referenced from the arithmetic objects)
//
// and no @implementation of the class existed anywhere in the package or on origin/main. That is an
// undefined symbol on a real link.
//
// So this is the class. It is NOT the arithmetic: MPSImageArithmetic's two scales and its bias live in
// MPSImageArithmetic13.m's category, which is the other half of the same arrangement the threshold
// kernels have on MPSUnaryImageKernel.
//
// What the header gives it, and what this file does with each:
//   :primaryOffset, :secondaryOffset   MPSOffset, each default {0,0,0}, each "the position of
//                                       clipRect.origin in source coordinates" - in the primary and
//                                       the secondary buffer respectively.
//   :primaryEdgeMode, :secondaryEdgeMode MPSImageEdgeMode, each default "usually MPSImageEdgeModeZero".
//   :clipRect                           MTLRegion, default MPSRectNoClip, intersected with the
//                                       destination bounds as the unary one is.
//
// -primarySourceRegionForDestinationSize: and -secondarySourceRegionForDestinationSize: are answered,
// because each is arithmetic on the offset it names and the clip rectangle, and the header says exactly
// which it consults: "The function will consult the MPSBinaryImageKernel primaryOffset and clipRect
// parameters" (:1), and the same for the secondary.
//
// OWED, refused by name rather than answered wrongly: the texture-path encodes and both in-place forms,
// which need a GPU kernel this port does not have and MPSCopyAllocator semantics. The MPSImage path is
// what this package implements; MPSImageArithmetic13.m's category carries it.

// as compiled here is incomplete, and the category is the other half. Same pragma, same reason, and no
