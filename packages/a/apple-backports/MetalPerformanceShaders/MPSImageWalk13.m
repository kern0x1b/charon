// channels sit together at `pixel * bytesPerPixel` with a row `bytesPerRow` from the next. The planar
// layouts of the 26.2 surface are not in this surface and are not invented here: an image whose channel
// format is one of those four is walked interleaved, and MPSImage13.m refuses the shapes it cannot hold.
