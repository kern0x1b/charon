// MPSNNResizeBilinear and MPSNNCropAndResizeBilinear, from MPSNNResize.h of the iPhoneOS 16.4 SDK.
// One object for one release: `python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py MPSNNResizeBilinear
// MPSNNCropAndResizeBilinear` answers 12.0 for both, and every other name this file defines is a
// member both headers declare at ios(12.0), so this file carries 12.0 API only.
//
// WHAT THE HEADERS ASK FOR. Both classes derive from MPSCNNKernel and both are "the source image
// resized using bilinear interpolation to a destination whose dimensions are given by resizeWidth
// and resizeHeight", with "the number of output feature channels ... the same as the number of input
// feature channels". MPSNNResizeBilinear adds one flag, alignCorners: "If YES, the centers of the 4
// corner pixels of the input and output regions are aligned, preserving the values at the corner
// pixels. The default is NO."
//
// So there are exactly two sampling conventions and they are both implemented here, each in one
// place, from the two properties' own wording:
//
//   alignCorners == YES   a corner pixel is preserved, so destination x maps onto source x as
//                         x * (sourceWidth - 1) / (destinationWidth - 1): the first and last
//                         destination pixels read the first and last source pixels with no blend.
//   alignCorners == NO    the CENTRES align, so the sampling point is the destination pixel's centre
//                         mapped by the ratio of the extents, less half a source pixel to get from a
//                         centre to an edge: (x + 0.5) * source / destination - 0.5. A destination of
//                         one pixel on an axis has its centre on the source's centre.
//
// Both then clamp: a sampling point before the first source pixel reads that pixel, and one past the
// last reads the last. That is what makes every sample fall inside the image, and it is the same rule
// MPSNNCropAndResizeBilinear's own doc gives for a region outside [0, 1] - except that this kernel
// extrapolates, which is below.
//
// MPSNNCropAndResizeBilinear takes its regions as `const MPSRegion *`, "a pointer to numberOfRegions
// boxes which specify the locations in the source image to use for each box/region ... The
// coordinates specified are normalized values." MPSRegion is { MPSOrigin origin; MPSSize size; } and
// both are doubles (MPSCoreTypes.h:321-338 and :355-359), so a region is read as the array of
// structs the header declares - not as an NSArray of boxes, and not through a coordinate convention
// of this file's own. The destination is resizeWidth by (resizeHeight * numberOfRegions), the crops
// stacked along its height, which is what a batch of crops of one image is in this framework.
//
// WHY THE WALK IS THIS FILE'S. The helpers in CharonMPSImage.h read a region into a buffer and write
// one back, and index a region's buffer row-major over width * channels per row. Both classes walk
// the DESTINATION and pick their source pixels, so the arithmetic here is one bilinear blend per
// channel per destination pixel and the four-neighbour index arithmetic is this file's alone.

#import "CharonMPS.h"
#import "CharonMPSImage.h"


// The source position a destination position samples, in HALF source pixels, so the bilinear weights
// stay exact and the fraction is either 0 or a half. `alignCorners` picks the convention; the result
// is clamped into [0, 2 * (size - 1)], which is what puts a sample at or past an edge onto that edge
// instead of off the image.
