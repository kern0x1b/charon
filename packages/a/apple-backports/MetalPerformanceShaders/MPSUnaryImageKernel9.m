// MPSUnaryImageKernel, from MPSImageKernel.h of the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface. One object per release: the
// class arrived in iOS 9, and the band machinery keeps an object whole or drops it whole.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. MPSImageThreshold13.m carries a CATEGORY on this class - the encode the five
// threshold kernels share - and a category cannot create the class it is written on. The five kernels
// and their category therefore reference _OBJC_CLASS_$_MPSUnaryImageKernel, and nothing in this package
// defined it: on an armv7 link it was an undefined symbol, measured as
//   MPSImageThreshold13.o  U _OBJC_CLASS_$_MPSUnaryImageKernel
// and neither origin/main nor any other band defined it either. So this is the class, written here.
//
// What the header gives it, and what this file does with each:
//   :offset      MPSOffset, default {0,0,0} - "the position of clipRect.origin in source coordinates",
//                default {0,0,0} meaning "the top left corners of the clipRect and source image align"
//   :clipRect    MTLRegion, default MPSRectNoClip - "the intersection between clip rectangle and
//                destination bounds is used", MPSRectNoClip being the whole destination. The sentinel
//                is resolved against the image by CharonMPSImageResolvedRegion before anything is read,
//                which is why no texture ever sees xoffset + width = -2.
//   :edgeMode    MPSImageEdgeMode, default "usually MPSImageEdgeModeZero" - the header's own hedge, and
//                this is the "usually" case: a filter that reads off the edge is not what this base is.
//
// -sourceRegionForDestinationSize: is answered, because it is arithmetic on the two properties above and
// the header says exactly what it consults: "The function will consult the MPSUnaryImageKernel offset and
// clipRect parameters, to determine the full region read by the function."
//
// OWED, and refused by name rather than answered wrongly:
//   -encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceTexture:destinationTexture: and its in-place and
//   -encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage:destinationImage: variants on raw textures. The MPSImage path is
//   what this package implements; the texture path is a GPU kernel this port does not have, and the
//   in-place form additionally needs MPSCopyAllocator semantics. A caller that reaches them is told so
//   rather than handed a texture nobody wrote.

// MPSImageKernel.h declares -encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage:destinationImage: on this class, and
// this file does not implement it: MPSImageThreshold13.m implements it, in a CATEGORY on this class,
// because it is the five threshold kernels' shared walk rather than anything this base does on its own.
// clang is right that the class as compiled here is incomplete, and the category is the other half. The
// same pragma MPSImageThreshold13.m carries for the same reason, and no diagnostic is silenced anywhere
// else in this package.
