// MPSCNNElements10.m - the convolutional elements iOS 10 added, in ONE object for the ONE release
// they belong to. Every number on these rows is a measurement of the host's own MPS and not of the
// header's wording: tests/backports/host/mpscnn10/run.sh is the harness (Apple M4 Pro, macOS 27.0) and
// each rule below was solved from its transcript.
//
// WHAT IS HERE, and what each class is:
//
//   MPSCNNNeuron          the base. At 10.0 it declares only a, b and c (:188-190) and marks
//                         -initWithDevice: NS_UNAVAILABLE (:195), so a 10.0 caller cannot build it
//                         by name and neither can a subclass reach its initialiser. It is here
//                         because five classes inherit from it, and it refuses to be built rather
//                         than answering as something it is not.
//   MPSCNNNeuronLinear    f(x) = a*x + b          :318
//   MPSCNNNeuronReLU      f(x) = x, else a*x      :351
//   MPSCNNNeuronSigmoid   f(x) = 1/(1+e^-x)       :429
//   MPSCNNNeuronTanH      f(x) = a*tanh(b*x)      :466
//   MPSCNNNeuronAbsolute  f(x) = |x|              :501
//   MPSCNNSoftMax         exp(x_k)/sum exp(x_q) ACROSS FEATURE CHANNELS, measured
//   MPSCNNLogSoftMax      x_k - ln(sum exp(x_q)), across feature channels, measured
//   MPSCNNSpatialNormalization       X/(delta + alpha/(kw*kh)*N2)^beta
//   MPSCNNLocalContrastNormalization pm + ps*(X - p0*M)/(delta + alpha*VAR)^beta
//   MPSCNNCrossChannelNormalization  X/L^beta, L over a channel window Q(k)
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, each with the measurement that decides it:
//
//   MPSCNNNeuron's -initWithDevice:neuronDescriptor: is 11.3 API (MPSCNNNeuron.h:207-208) and its
//   -neuronType and -data are 11.0 (:187, :191), so NONE of them is defined in this file. The class
//   is a 10.0 class that is not directly constructible at 10.0, which is why -initWithDevice: refuses
//   below rather than pretending to be the base's own way in. MPSImageGaussianBlur's row in this same
//   file is the same shape of thing and says so in as many words.
//
//   MPSCNNFullyConnected's header says ios(10.0) (:1342) but it is not in this object. Its superclass
//   MPSCNNConvolution is already carried (MPSCNNConvolution10.m), so placement is not the blocker;
//   its weights arrive through id<MPSCNNConvolutionDataSource>, a protocol whose own rows are 11.3,
//   and whose -copyWithZone:device: and -weightsLayout the owed facts page lists against no header
//   at all. A class that builds and cannot be given weights is a symbol that loads and lies.
//
//   MPSImageConversion needs a CGColorConversionInfoRef (MPSImageConversion.h:60-64); first-rung
//   answers _CGColorConversionInfoCreate at 10.0.1 and the whole CoreGraphics colour-conversion
//   family is absent from this port (registry/CoreGraphics/absent_CoreGraphics.json).
//
//   MPSImagePyramid and MPSImageGaussianPyramid: the classes resolve and hold their parameters -
//   kernelWidth 5 and kernelHeight 5 by default, 3x3 from the custom initialiser, all measured -
//   but their encode is the in-place mip-level fill (MPSImageConvolution.h:513-520) and running it
//   against this host's own MPS on an 8x8 R32Float texture with four mip levels takes the process
//   down with SIGSEGV, exit 139. The port's MPSImage13.m also makes every texture with mipmapped:NO
//   (:253), so there are no mip levels for the fill to write: the same gap seen from this side.
//   Nothing here is decided dead; what is missing is a substrate that answers the encode.
//
//   MPSImageLaplacianPyramid, MPSImageLaplacianPyramidAdd and MPSImageLaplacianPyramidSubtract are
//   NOT in this release at all: first-rung answers 12.0 for all three against 10.0.1 for the twelve
//   above, so a 10.0 object carrying them would mix two releases. They are 12.0 work and their rows
//   are flipped to say so.
//
// FOUR RULES THE HEADER DOES NOT GIVE, OR GIVES IN A FORM THE RELEASE DOESN'T USE. Each was solved
// from the host's own answers:
//
//   SPATIAL, the window. The header gives no window for MPSCNNSpatialNormalization itself; the
//   gradient's formula at MPSCNNNormalization.h:60-62 gives L(i) = [i-floor((kw-1)/2), i+floor(kw/2],
//   which as a kw x kw block is CENTRED on the output, and that is what the release computes.
//   MEASURED at kw=3, where a centred window (first = -1) and a backward one (first = -2) are different
//   windows: the host agrees with centred to 3.0e-06 and disagrees with backward by 7.7e+04.
//
//   AND A CASE THAT COULD NOT HAVE TOLD, recorded because it is the kind of measurement that looks like
//   evidence and is not. An earlier version of this file claimed an EVEN kernel's window reaches BACK,
//   on the strength of a kw=2 case over a 4x4 of 1..16 whose sixteen implied N2 values (1, 5, 26, 66,
//   25, 26, 98, 138, 106, 242, 306, 378, 250, 546, 642, 746) were all reproduced. For a 2-wide kernel a
//   centred window starts at -(2/2) = -1 and a backward one at -2+1 = -1: the SAME two pixels. Every one
//   of the sixteen values was consistent with both rules and the case distinguished nothing. The claim
//   and its flag are gone; the kw=3 measurement is what the row now rests on.
//   LOCAL CONTRAST, p0's default. :151-153 says p0 defaults to 1.0, and the measurement needs it: at
//   alpha 0 the denominator is the constant delta^beta, so the host's answer solves M = X - Y*delta^beta
//   and at (0,0) that is 1.55555558 against the centred 3x3 mean 1.55555556. With p0 = 0 this file
//   would answer 32 where the host answers -17.7777786.
//   CROSS CHANNEL, the divisor and the window. :381-387 says alpha/N with "N is the kernel size",
//   over Q(k) = [max(0,k-floor(N/2)), min(D-1,k+floor((N-1)/2))]. Measured with kernelSize 3, the
//   divisor implied by the host is 3.000000 at all twelve outputs checked, where the window lengths
//   are 2, 3 and 2 for channels 0, 1 and 2 - so it is the kernelSize and not the window's length.
//   Q(k) is ASYMMETRIC: channel 0 sees channels 0 and 1, channel 1 sees all three, and channel 0's
//   measured answer is 1.24184335e-05. Symmetrising the window would change it.
//   SOFTMAX is ACROSS FEATURE CHANNELS, not across pixels. Measured on a 4x4 of two channels whose
//   values differ: every pixel answers 0.268941432 / 0.731058598, which is sigmoid(1-2) - the two
//   channels at THAT pixel. A softmax over the sixteen pixels of a row would answer sixteen different
//   numbers.
//
// ACCUMULATION IS IN DOUBLE and the store is float32, so each result is within a float32 ulp of the
// exact expression and not bit-identical to the host's. The harness compares these to a written-down
// tolerance and still compares the pooling cases beside them exactly.
