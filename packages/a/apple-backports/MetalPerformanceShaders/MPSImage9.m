// MPSImage9.m - the three MPSImage kernels SDK 16.4's own headers mark ios(9.0) whose every declared
// member this port can answer, and the whole of whose class chain is 9.0.
//
// One object for one release: every @implementation below is a class whose header annotation is
// ios(9.0) (MPSImageIntegral.h:31 and :52, MPSImageConvolution.h:290), and nothing else is in this file.
//
// THE HIERARCHY IS THE RELEASE'S AND IS KEPT. All three are declared by SDK 16.4 under
// Frameworks/MPSImage.framework/Headers, so a class the SDK declares cannot be re-declared here and
// none is: each inherits MPSUnaryImageKernel, which MPSUnaryImageKernel9.m carries on the same 9.0
// annotation. None of the three declares a member that is not answered here; MPSImageIntegral.h:33-35
// and :54-56 are "@end" straight after the @interface, and MPSImageSobel's four members are this file's.
//
// WHAT IS COMPUTED, from the headers' own wording, one kernel at a time:
//
//   MPSImageIntegral / MPSImageIntegralOfSquares  MPSImageIntegral.h:17-21 and :38-42 give the sum
//     rectangle exactly: "sumRect.origin = MPSUnaryImageKernel.offset" and "sumRect.size =
//     dest_position - MPSUnaryImageKernel.clipRect.origin". The value at a destination position is the
//     sum of the source over that rectangle, and the OfSquares variant sums the squares
//     (MPSImageIntegral.h:38 "the sum of squared pixels"). That is arithmetic this port does exactly.
//
//   MPSImageSobel    MPSImageConvolution.h:282-288 gives the luminance the filter runs on
//     ("Luminance = v[0] * pixel.x + v[1] * pixel.y + v[2] * pixel.z") and :301-302 its default
//     transform, BT.601/JPEG {0.299f, 0.587f, 0.114f}. The operator is the 3x3 Sobel pair, which
//     :350-352 states for the same header's Canny step: "G = sqrt(Sx^2 + Sy^2)", "G_ang = arctan(Sy/Sx)".
//     NOT the non-maximum suppression of :353-360: that is step 3 of MPSImageCANNY's five, and this
//     class's own @discussion says only that it "implements the Sobel filter". The row says so too.
//
// NO ORACLE FOR APPLE'S CODE ON THIS HOST, and no claim of one: the release's own kernels die encoding
// here, because this host's AGX family does not implement computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:.
// Every number checked for these three is this port's own answer against a plain C reference written
// from the wording above, in the same process - facts/MetalPerformanceShaders/Image9.md.
//
// THE TWO 9.0 ROWS THIS FILE DOES NOT CARRY, both named in that facts page and owed rather than
// answered, and neither of them because a GPU is missing:
//   MPSImageMedian   MPSImageMedian.h:67 and :71 declare +maxKernelDiameter and +minKernelDiameter,
//                    and NO header in either SDK states a value for either. The median itself is
//                    computable, but two of the class's own members have no answer, and a class that
//                    loads and answers those two with a number this port invented is the thing the
//                    rules forbid. Owed.
//   MPSImageLanczosScale  MPSImageResampling.h:29 annotates its base MPSImageScale ios(11.0) while
//                    :122 annotates LanczosScale itself ios(9.0) - a later base under an earlier
//                    class, which is the release's own hierarchy. Carrying it in a 9.0 object would
//                    put a class that arrived at 11.0 in a 9.0 file, which is the mixed-release object
//                    the band machinery must not be given. Owed with the 11.0 surface.

// where MPSKernel9.m:74-82 puts it for the whole family - the release does not define it per subclass

// answer is written. CharonMPSImageReadRegion is the layer's own read of that region and
// CharonMPSImageLoad its own load, so the addressing is still the layer's and only the arithmetic
// moves into this file - the division CharonMPSImage.h's own comment describes.
