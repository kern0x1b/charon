// MPSNNFilterNode - the graph's virtual filter base, and the edges every node in a graph shares.
//
// ONE OBJECT FOR ONE RELEASE, and the release is 12.0. Not 11.0, which is where the header puts the class
// (MPSNNGraphNodes.h:338, MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING ios(11.0)) and where the class demonstrably is: it
// is in the arm64 shared cache of the 11.0 release's own inventory, with superclass NSObject and twelve
// instance selectors. What is not there at 11.0 is its EXPORT - `_OBJC_CLASS_$_MPSNNFilterNode` is in no
// image's export trie at 11.0 and first appears at 12.0, and `first_releases` reads the trie, so 12.0 is
// what backports.lua's measured_names()/releases_in() place this class at and therefore what
// `misplaced()` refuses to mix with an 11.0 name. Measured with dyld.load + dyld.exported_at over the held
// ladder (armv7 preferred), the class symbol and the metaclass symbol agreeing:
//
//   11.0  MPSNNFilterNode: exported by NO image          12.0: exported     16.0: exported
//
// THAT MEANS IT IS THE SUPERCLASS OF SEVEN CLASSES THAT ARRIVE EARLIER, which reads backwards and is
// Apple's own export history rather than a defect: MPSNNAdditionNode, MPSNNSubtractionNode,
// MPSNNMultiplicationNode, MPSNNDivisionNode, MPSNNConcatenationNode, MPSCNNPoolingAverageNode and
// MPSCNNPoolingMaxNode are all exported from 11.0 with this base unexported until 12.0. It costs nothing
// here because the hierarchy is not built by name at runtime: a subclass names its superclass as a
// link-time symbol, and a band that keeps an 11.0 object keeps this one too, so the reference resolves in
// the same dylib. The base's own initialiser is what an MPSNNGraph of this port calls, and it is here.
//
// WHAT THE CLASS IS. MPSNNGraphNodes.h:340 says "This is a virtual base class. Make MPSNNFilterNode
// subclass objects instead", and :341 marks -init NS_UNAVAILABLE, so the release never builds one by name.
// What this object carries is everything a node in a graph shares: the node's sources, its one result
// image position, the kernel it stands for, the device that kernel is made against, the shape its result
// takes, and the pairing a walk reads to go from a result image back to the filter that produced it.
//
// THE PAIRING IS A CLASS METHOD rather than a C function, and that is a band constraint. A C function
// shared by two backport files is the trap AGENTS.md names: a file whose exports a band's release already
// has is left out of that band, so the call is an undefined symbol in later bands only - backports-gate
// links one band and passes and only the all-band build shows it. An Objective-C message across the two
// objects is the route that rule asks for, and it is why +charon_mps_producers is declared in
// CharonMPSNN.h and implemented here while the walk that reads it is in MPSNNGraph11.m.
//
// WHAT THE -Wincomplete-implementation WARNING IS TURNED OFF FOR, and it is one list and one reason.
//
// MPSNNFilterNode's @interface in MPSNNGraphNodes.h:338-486 declares five methods this object does not
// implement, and every one of them is the training half of the graph:
//
//   -gradientFilterWithSource:                                  :404   returns MPSNNGradientFilterNode*
//   -gradientFilterWithSources:                                 :412   returns MPSNNGradientFilterNode*
//   -gradientFiltersWithSources:                                :420   returns MPSNNGradientFilterNode*
//   -gradientFiltersWithSource:                                 :428   returns MPSNNGradientFilterNode*
//   -trainingGraphWithSourceGradient:nodeHandler:               :466   MPS_AVAILABLE_STARTING ios(12.0)
//
// MPSNNGradientFilterNode is 12.0 by the same export ladder that places this class there, so implementing
// any of the five would put a 12.0 name in a 12.0 object that is otherwise this class - which is fine -
// but the gradient half is not built at all, so the five have nothing to return: MPSNNGradientFilterNode
// is `absent` in the registry and no object in this package defines it. Carrying the five would mean
// carrying that class, which is the 12.0 gradient object and a piece of work of its own; the registry
// rows for the five are `owed` with that reason.
//
// The suppression is push/pop around this one @implementation and names its five methods in the comment
// above, rather than a file-wide `#pragma clang diagnostic ignored` with no record of what it hides. The
// alternative that needs no pragma at all - defining the five - needs the class they return, and neither
// `@dynamic` nor a category on this class silences the warning (measured: clang answers "method definition
// for 'gamma' not found" and "property implementation must have its declaration in interface" for
// `@dynamic gamma;`).
