// CharonMPS26.h - the names the 26.2 surface has and the SDK this package compiles against does not.
//
// The iPhoneOS 16.4 SDK is what this package compiles against, and MetalPerformanceShaders moved
// between it and 26.2. Where 26.2 declares a member that 16.4 does not, the member is transcribed here
// from the 26.2 headers, so that an application built against the 26.2 surface compiles at all. Each one
// is a name no header this build compiles against declares, and each is an R4 item: the lift's sets have
// to be re-measured in the push that lands it.
//
// Transcribed is not the same as implemented, and the two are not confused here. Four of the members
// below are implemented and the rest are declarations only:
//
//   implemented   MPSGraphObject (MPSGraphObject15.m), and MPSCNNConvolutionDescriptor's
//                 charon_mps_neuronParameterC, charon_mps_setNeuronParameterC: and
//                 charon_mps_hasBatchNormalization (MPSCNNConvolutionDescriptor10.m)
//   declaration   MPSGraphFFTDescriptor, MPSGraphImToColOpDescriptor and
//                 MPSGraphExecutableSerializationDescriptor, which have no @implementation anywhere in
//                 this package and no registry row: an application that names one of them compiles and
//                 then has nothing to link against, which is a link error the reader will see at once
//                 and not a silent wrong answer. They are declared so the 26.2 surface is complete, not
//                 so it is answered.
//
// Transcribed from $SDK26/System/Library/Frameworks/MetalPerformanceShaders.framework/Frameworks,
// read on 2026-09-28. Nothing here is invented: it is what 26.2 says, copied.
