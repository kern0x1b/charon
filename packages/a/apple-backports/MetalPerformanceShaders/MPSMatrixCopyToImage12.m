// MPSMatrixCopyToImage, from MPSMatrixToImage.h of the iPhoneOS 26.2 surface. One object for one
// release: `python3 tools/cache-index/first-rung.py` answers 12.0 for MPSMatrixCopyToImage and for
// every other name in this file, so this file carries 12.0 API only.
//
// WHAT IT IS. The copy between a matrix and an image, one direction of the two MPSMatrixToImage.h
// declares. A matrix is a rows x columns array with its own strides and its own batch count; an image
// is a width x height x featureChannels rectangle. The two shapes never agree on their own - a matrix
// of one row and eight columns is an eight-channel image of width one, not an image of width eight -
// so the mapping is a choice and the header makes it explicit, through four properties:
//
//   dataLayout            MPSDataLayoutHeightxWidthxFeatureChannels or ...xChannelsxHeightxWidth.
//                         The first says the matrix's OWN row and column count ARE an image's height
//                         and width, and its columns are the feature channels: the matrix must then be
//                         rows == height, columns == featureChannels, and every row is one row of the
//                         image. The second says the transpose of that: rows == featureChannels,
//                         columns == width.
//   sourceMatrixOrigin    the row and column the copy starts from, in the matrix's own coordinates.
//   sourceMatrixBatchIndex which matrix of a batched matrix this copies from.
//
// So the copy has no arithmetic at all: it moves elements, and what decides where an element lands is
// the layout, which is why both directions of the layout are one switch in one place below rather
// than two walks.
