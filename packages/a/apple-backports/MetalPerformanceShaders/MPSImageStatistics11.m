// MPSImageStatisticsMinAndMax, MPSImageStatisticsMeanAndVariance and MPSImageStatisticsMean, from
// MPSImageStatistics.h of the iPhoneOS 16.4 surface. One object for one release: each of the three
// carries MPS_CLASS_AVAILABLE_STARTING(macos(10.13), ios(11.0), macCatalyst(13.0), tvos(11.0)) above
// its own declaration (MPSImageStatistics.h:24, :72, :117), so every @implementation below is a
// release-11.0 class and nothing else is in this file.
//
// What decides that this is a CPU walk and not an opaque encoder call is the RELEASE'S OWN CACHE, read
// with tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over $HOME/.charon/dyld/16.0/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e: all three
// declare NO encode of their own. MPSImageStatisticsMinAndMax's entire instance list is -clipRectSource,
// -initWithCoder:device: and -initWithDevice:, MPSImageStatisticsMean's is the same three. The walk is
// the one they INHERIT from MPSUnaryImageKernel, and MPSUnaryImageKernel is a class this port already
// carries (image.json, introduced 9.0, implemented) whose own
// -encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage:destinationImage: is a CPU walk here, as MPSImage9.m's and
// MPSImageReduce12.m's are. So the encode is implemented per concrete class and NOT in the base: a
// category cannot read the ivars the base declares, which MPSImageReduceUnary16.m:29-40 already records
// for the same family of reduction over an image.
//
// THE WALK IS NOT NEW, and that is the point. CharonMPSImageReadRegion / CharonMPSImageWriteRegion and
// CharonMPSImageLoad / CharonMPSImageStore are the pair every MPSImage kernel in this package reads and
// writes through - MPSImageIntegral (MPSImage9.m) sums a rectangle with them, MPSImageThreshold13.m
// compares an element with them, MPSImageReduce12.m reduces a row or a column with them - and this file
// reuses them rather than writing a second answer for the same walk. The window here is the one those
// kernels already resolve: CharonMPSImageResolvedRegion intersects a clip rectangle with the image, and
// CharonMPSImageRegionIsEmpty is what says a window with no pixels does no work at all.
//
// What the header fixes, and what it does not:
//
//   - What each class computes. MPSImageStatistics.h:18 "computes the minimum and maximum pixel values
//     for a given region of an image", :66 "computes the mean and variance", :114 "computes the mean".
//     A minimum and a maximum SELECT values the source already holds, so they are exact and the
//     differential compares them for EQUALITY - a copy that moved a bit is a copy that moved a bit.
//   - WHERE the answers go, which is the header's own sentence and not this file's arithmetic:
//     MPSImageStatistics.h:19-21 "min value is written at pixel location (0, 0)" and "max value is
//     written at pixel location (1, 0)". The mean and the variance have no such sentence here and are
//     written along the destination's first row in that order, which is the shape a caller reading two
//     values out of one kernel expects and is recorded in the rows below as this file's choice.
//   - The read window: MPSImageStatistics.h:28-33 clipRectSource, "If the clipRectSource does not lie
//     completely within the source image, the intersection of the image bounds and clipRectSource will be
//     used", and "The clipRectSource replaces the MPSUnaryImageKernel offset parameter for this filter.
//     The latter is ignored. Default: MPSRectNoClip, use the entire source texture." So offset does not
//     enter these three kernels, and the window is an INTERSECTION with the image.
//   - What the destination's clipRect means, which is DIFFERENT from the source's and is stated:
//     MPSImageStatistics.h:35-36 "The clipRect specified in MPSUnaryImageKernel is used to control the
//     origin in the destination texture where the min, max values are written. The clipRect.width must
//     be >=2. The clipRect.height must be >= 1." A destination narrower than two pixels cannot hold the
//     min and the max at (0,0) and (1,0), and this file refuses that BY NAME with the shape in the
//     message rather than writing the second value past the edge.
//
// Arithmetic: the sum is taken in double and divided ONCE, which leaves a mean and a variance within one
// whole float32 ulp of the answer. That bound is the one MPSImageReduce's rows already state and is not
// widened here. The variance is the mean of the SQUARED DEVIATIONS (sum((x - mean)^2) / count), not the
// mean of the squares minus the square of the mean: the header says "the mean and variance" of the
// region and the second central moment is what a variance is, and the two forms differ in the last bits
// on any input where they differ at all.
