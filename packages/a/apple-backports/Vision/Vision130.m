/* Vision of iOS 13.0, and only that: the names this object carries are the ones no earlier release
 * exports -- every symbol below first appears in the 16.0 arm64e cache, which is the first held rung
 * after the hole where 13.0, 14.0 and 15.0 would sit -- and every measurement behind them is in
 * facts/Vision/Absence.md with the command that produced it.
 *
 * A release that has Vision cannot be told what to do about any of it from a header, because the
 * recognisers behind these requests are Apple's own and Apple has published no source for Vision at
 * all (coordination/corpus/sources.md, measured 2026-09-30). What IS knowable is the shape: the two
 * releases this port deploys on carry no Vision image whatever, so a name here is a name the release
 * has never heard of, and the question each row answers is what this port does with it.
 *
 * What each answer below is:
 *   - VNElementTypeSize and the two animal identifiers answer with values measured out of a Vision
 *     image and not out of a name (the name of a constant is never its value);
 *   - +revision:supportsConstellation: answers the truth table Apple's own answers, for the pairs
 *     Apple's own Vision was asked about;
 *   - the precision and recall addition answers NO, which is what the gate its own header describes
 *     says a caller must read before sending the two methods beside it;
 *   - a request class is declared and its revision table answers from the port's own, and running it
 *     comes back from the request handler as VNErrorNotImplemented -- the refusal every request of
 *     iOS 11 and 12 this port cannot run already answers with, so a caller tests an error rather
 *     than losing the process to an unrecognised class.
 *
 * Every METHOD the headers of these twelve classes declare is written down here as well as every
 * property, because clang synthesises a property and never a method. Four of them are:
 *
 *   - +knownAnimalIdentifiersForRevision:error: answers the two identifiers this file exports, which
 *     is all of the list, and refuses a revision the port's own table does not carry;
 *   - -topCandidates:, -boundingBoxForRange:error: and -computeDistance:toFeaturePrintObservation:error:
 *     each answer for an observation of the port's own that carries nothing, which is what Apple
 *     answers for the same class with nothing in it (measured for the first two; the third cannot be
 *     measured, because this host's Vision does not instantiate VNFeaturePrintObservation at all, and
 *     the method says so where a reader of it is).
 *
 * Three methods these headers declare are NOT written down, and the reason is written down with them
 * in facts/Vision/Absence.md section 7: each reports a catalogue this port does not have -- 1303
 * classification names, and the language codes of a text recogniser -- and a list of another
 * release's copied in would be a wrong answer rather than a missing one.
 */

/* The identifiers an animal recognition answer carries, with the texts Apple's Vision gives them.
 *
 * "Cat" and "Dog", measured twice and read the same way both times: out of the Vision image of the

 * cache-value.lua), and out of the Vision of this host through VNAnimalIdentifierCat itself. The
