// What the subscription family of this package shares.
//
// The SDK's CKSubscription declares no initialiser at all - a caller is meant to build one of the
// three subclasses - so the base class's own designated initialiser, the one that takes the name the
// service will know it by, is declared here for the subclasses in the other files of this folder. It
// is the port's declaration and not the SDK's, which is why it is not in the registry: no SDK header
// names it, and the rule that covers such a name is R4 of .agents/skills/patch-merge, which says the
// lift's sets are re-measured in the same push.
