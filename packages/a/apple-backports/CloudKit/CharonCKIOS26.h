// CloudKit's iOS 26 sharing-access surface, transcribed from the iOS 26.2 headers.
//
// The SDK this package builds against is 16.4 and declares none of it, so the port declares it here
// and **every class and every member below is a rule R4 case**: the lift's sets are re-measured for
// all of them in this push.
//
// Why a plain transcription can live in a header at all: the build compiles with
// -Werror=objc-missing-property-synthesis, and that check fires on *implicit* synthesis. The
// @implementation in CKOperations26.m therefore carries an explicit @synthesize for each of its
// properties, so a declaration here and an implementation in that file is fine.
