// AVPlayerViewControllerSpeeds16.m - the 16.0 playback speed API: AVPlaybackSpeed, and the three
// members of AVPlayerViewController that carry it. One object, one release: every name below is
// ios(16.0) in the SDK 26.2 header, and the registry's minimum places the whole object.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED, and where each value came from. The rates and the two kinds of name are the
// system's own answers, read out of the host's AVKit by tests/backports/host/avkitspeeds/host.m
// (locale en_US@rg=plzzzz, 5 speeds, fastest first):
//
//     speed: rate=2     name=Double numeric=2x        <- the real character is U+00D7
//     speed: rate=1.5   name=Faster numeric=1,5x
//     speed: rate=1.25  name=Fast   numeric=1,25x
//     speed: rate=1     name=Normal numeric=1x
//     speed: rate=0.5   name=Half   numeric=0,5x
//     made:  rate=1.75  name=port probe numeric=1,75x
//
// Two facts in that output carry the implementation. First, +systemDefaultSpeeds is ordered
// fastest first, so the port's list is in that order and not sorted by us. Second, a speed built by
// the public initialiser with the name "port probe" still answers the numeric name "1,75x": the
// numeric name is not stored, it is computed from the rate, so this class derives it and the digits
// come out of the DEVICE's own locale rather than out of a string typed here. That is why the
// separator above is a comma (the measured locale's) while the source of this file stays ASCII and
// the multiplication sign is written as an escape.
//
// The release's own substrate, measured in the armv7 shared cache of 6.1.3 (568965 names): the
// AVPlayer `rate` property, `canPlayFastForward` and `canPlaySlowForward` are all there (`rate`
// first appears at 3.0, the two capability selectors at 5.0), and this port's transport bar already
// reads `player.rate` to decide whether to draw play or pause. `defaultRate` is NOT there - it
// first appears at 16.0 - which is the one place this port parts company with the header and says so
// below rather than inventing a stand-in for it.
//
// THE DEVIATION, in the header's own terms. AVPlaybackSpeed.h:51 documents that the rate "will be
// set in response to the play button being pressed", and AVPlayerViewController.h:187 documents that
// selectedSpeed tracks the associated AVPlayer's `defaultRate` in both directions. This release has
// no `defaultRate` to track, so the port keeps the selection itself and applies it on the same event
// the header names: -selectSpeed: takes effect at once when the player is already playing, and
// otherwise on the next press of play, which AVPlayerViewController.m's own -charon_playPause: calls
// through -charon_applySelectedSpeed. Nothing here is a stored value that is never read.
