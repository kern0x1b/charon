// What a resolution result holds, read back.
//
// INIntentResolutionResult's own surface in the SDK is three class methods and nothing else:
// on a release with Siri, the system is the reader of the result — it asks a handler's app for
// a value, the app answers with +successWithResolved…: or +confirmationRequired…:, and the
// system reads the value out of the result itself. This release runs no assistant daemon, so
// the app that resolves a parameter is the reader, and the four declarations below are where it
// reads what it just stored. They are named as Charon's own, in a header of this package, so
// they collide with nothing Apple has and they are absent on a release that carries
// Intents.framework itself (where the system's own result answers instead).
//
// The status is what the header's three names say: needsValue asks the user, notRequired says
// the parameter needs nothing, unsupported says the parameter cannot be resolved at all, and
// success / disambiguation / confirmationRequired are the three answers the typed factories
// build.
