//
//  INMessage's own members of iOS 18: the two initialisers that take a referenced message, a
//  sticker and a reaction, and the sticker and the reaction they keep. Four rows of
//  registry/Intents/ios10.json, and this file is the object that answers them.
//
//  Why a category, and why not in IN10_0_1.m
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  INMessage is carried from iOS 10.0 and its @implementation is IN10_0_1.m, which
//  tools/intents/gen-intents.py writes from the port's own SDK. That SDK is iPhoneOS 16.4
//  (generate.sh's PORT_SDK), and 16.4's INMessage.h declares none of these four: measured,
//  `grep -n 'sticker\|reaction\|referencedMessage\|DESIGNATED' INMessage.h` over each of the three
//  16.4 SDKs on this machine answers only three lines - the NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER of 11.0, of
//  13.2 and of 16.0 - and no property at all. So the generator has nothing in its AST to emit,
//  which is why these four rows came out of it as "the SDK's own headers do not declare this
//  member".
//
//  The contract is therefore read where it is written - iPhoneOS 26.2's INMessage.h, lines 139
//  to 178 for the two initialisers and 206 to 210 for the two properties, word for word - and the
//  port writes it for itself, which is what CharonIntents262.h is for: the declarations this
//  package's SDK does not have. The two types are not new to the port either: INSticker and
//  INMessageReaction are two of the four classes of the 18.0 group and IN18_0.m defines both.
//
//  Why this file and not IN10_0_1.m, and this is a coordination answer and not an architectural one.
//  A member does not have to arrive in its own object's release: IN10_0_1.m already carries
//  INMessage.serviceName (13.2), INMessage.groupName (11.0) and INMessage.audioMessageFile (16.0),
//  and INIntent.donationMetadata (15.0) was put beside its class in CharonIntents100.m. So the
//  tree's own shape would put these four there too. This slice holds ONE object, the one for
//  18.0; IN10_0_1.m is the 10.0 group's generated object and rewriting it is another slice's file,
//  and the generator would have to be changed to emit them. So they are here instead, and the
//  difference that choice costs is named at the bottom of this comment.
//
//  The two values are held beside the object rather than in it, because a **category cannot add an
//  ivar to a class another object implements**, and the file says so. That is the whole cost of
//  putting a member of someone else's class in an object of its own release, and it is the cost
//  Photos/PHPickerConfiguration15.m pays for the same thing.
//
//  What a caller gets
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Both initialisers chain to -initWithIdentifier:...groupName:messageType:serviceName:, which
//  IN10_0_1.m implements and which keeps every value these two parameters name. It is the 13.2
//  initialiser rather than the 16.4 designated one, because the 18.0 pair has no audioMessageFile
//  parameter to hand it - the 26.2 header marks that property deprecated and unavailable on ios -
//  so there is nothing to pass and nothing of the class's own state is left unset.
//
//  INMessage declares NSCopying and NSSecureCoding. Without the three methods at the bottom of
//  this file a copy and an archive would carry the whole object except these values, which is a
//  silent wrong answer rather than a crash, so the three are here. Each calls the package's own
//  helper from CharonCoding.h and adds this file's values, so none of them repeats the ivar walk
//  the class already does - a copy made here still carries everything the class gains later.
//  Were these four in IN10_0_1.m instead, charon_intents_copy's own ivar walk would carry them
//  and none of the three would be needed.
//
//  referencedMessage: is a parameter and not a property: the 26.2 header declares no accessor for
//  it, and this port adds none, because an accessor the SDK does not declare is not a backport.
//  The value the caller handed is kept rather than dropped, so the object is whole, and nothing
//  reads it back because nothing can.
