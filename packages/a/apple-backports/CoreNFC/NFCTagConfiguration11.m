// The tag command configurations as iOS 11.0 has them: NFCTagCommandConfiguration and the two
// subclasses of it the ISO15693 tag declares. All three arrived in iOS 11.0, so they are all here;
// the classes and members iOS 13.0 added to the framework are elsewhere, because an object carries
// the API of one release.
//
// A configuration is a value. It is made with the fields an application sets, read back through its
// properties, and copied; nothing in it is a session, a tag or a radio, so it is made and used on a
// 4S and an iPad 2 exactly as it is on a device with an NFC radio. What it is FOR needs a session and
// a tag, and the sessions of the framework answer as a device without the radio does: +readingAvailable
// is NO and a session cannot be made (facts/CoreNFC/NFCReaderSession.md). So a caller here can build,
// keep and copy a configuration, and cannot send it anywhere - which is the one thing a configuration
// exists for, and is absent for a reason of its own rather than by a stub answering.
//
// The semantics below are the host's own, measured rather than read off the header, which states valid
// ranges but does not say what happens outside them (facts/CoreNFC/TagConfiguration.md):
//   - every field is kept exactly as it was given. A manufacturer code of 0x1FF stays 0x1FF although
//     the header calls 0x00 to 0xFF valid, maximumRetries of 1000 stays 1000 although the header calls
//     0 to 256 valid, a retry interval of -5 stays -5, and a zero-length read range stays zero length
//     although the header says length shall not be 0. Nothing clamps and nothing raises: the host
//     answers with the number it was given in every one of those cases.
//   - -init leaves every field zero and requestParameters nil. The three- and four-field initialisers
//     of each subclass set what they name and leave the retry fields of the base at zero, which is what
//     the header says they do ("Initialize with default zero maximum retry and zero retry interval")
//     and what the host answers.
//   - -copy is NSCopying and the copy is independent: setting requestParameters on the copy leaves the
//     original's alone, and a copy of a subclass is the subclass, carrying the base's retry fields too.
//     -isEqual: is NSObject's, so two configurations with identical fields are not equal: measured
//     isEqual 0 for two objects built from the same range, chunk size, retries and interval.
//
// The members that arrived after 11.0 are not here: -[NFCTag identifier], -[NFCTag available],
// -[NFCTag asNFCISO15693Tag] and the rest of the tag protocol, and the reader sessions themselves, are
// objects this release does not have.
