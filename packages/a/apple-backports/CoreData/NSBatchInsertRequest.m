// NSBatchInsertRequest: the batch insert of Core Data, which the release does not have.
//
// The release's Core Data arrived in iOS 3.0, its batch DELETE and batch UPDATE arrived with the
// iOS 9.0 backports beside it - NSBatchDeleteRequest.m and NSBatchUpdateRequest.m are in this
// package - and the batch INSERT arrived at iOS 13.0 with nothing carrying it. The 16.4 header the
// port lifts DECLARES the class, with an empty ivar block and SIX properties it has nowhere
// to keep (NSBatchInsertRequest.h:20,21,23,24,25,28), so the storage is in the class
// extension below and this file is only what that declaration does not carry. It is NOT in
// CharonCoreData.h: an ivar block may only appear in a class's one interface, the SDK has it, and a
// second @interface for this class is a duplicate definition.
// The types are the header's own (NSBatchInsertRequest.h:17-43), not the corpus's selector list,
// which spells labels and not types: both handlers RETURN BOOL, and objects: takes dictionaries on
// both the name and the entity form. The enum and NSBatchInsertRequestResultTypeCount are
// Apple's and are not redeclared here.
//
// What a batch insert DOES, and the boundary of this file. The handlers are called once per row BY
// THE STORE, and this port's store is the backports' coordinator over a release that has no batch
// insert at all: there is no C function to hand the request to. So this class is the request as a
// value - the entity, the rows, the handler, the result type - and it is what a program written
// against 13.0 configures. A caller that needs its rows in a store uses the store's own path, and
// the differential for this step is over exactly that: the request's own state, on the port's own
// in-memory store, with no write to any system store.

#import <CoreData/CoreData.h>
#import "CharonCoreData.h"

// The storage. The SDK declares the class with an EMPTY ivar block (NSBatchInsertRequest.h:17),
// so this extension is where its SIX properties are kept (NSBatchInsertRequest.h:20,21,23,24,25,28).
// It is here rather than in CharonCoreData.h because an ivar block may only appear in a class's one
// interface and the SDK has that one: a second @interface for NSBatchInsertRequest is "duplicate
// interface definition", which is exactly what the shared header produced.

   the class (see -init above) keep Apple's own words. A request made with an entity answers it --
   the host's answer for that form is entity=Row -- and a request with nothing to insert answers nil,
