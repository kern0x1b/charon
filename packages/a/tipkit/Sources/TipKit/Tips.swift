// TipKit: the tips an app offers, the rules that decide which one to show, and the events that record
// what the owner did with them.
//
// A tip is a piece of advice with a rule: "when the owner has been ignoring the search for a week, show
// them the shortcut". The rules, the display count, the donations and the datastore are all the app's
// own, and every one of them is a value here. What TipKit's system service adds is the *presentation*:
// the popover the system draws over the app's own views. These releases have no such service, so the
// tip is drawn in the app, by the views at the bottom of this module. `facts/TipKit/Rendering.md`.
