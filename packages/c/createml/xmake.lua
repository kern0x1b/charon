The Swift modules - CoreML, the shaped-array overlay CreateML's linear models are constrained to; CreateMLComponents; and CreateML - built against the charon@swift-runtime a port carries, so a program writes `import CreateML`. The linear algebra is the Accelerate of the release: cblas_dgemm, cblas_dsyrk, cblas_dgemv, cblas_ddot, dgesv_ and dpotrf_ are the armv7 dyld cache's own symbols from 4.3 up, and the package adds no matrix code of its own. The .mlmodel export is a protobuf writer over the published coremltools schema, in this package's own CoreML module, and the linear model writes through it; the five tree and classifier estimators are declared and refuse, because their kind of model is a TreeEnsembleRegressor or a NeuralNetworkClassifier and not a neural network")

    -- overlay, `CreateMLComponents` the estimators, and `CreateML` the `MLDataTable` and the
