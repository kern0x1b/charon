// Columns.swift — the columns a `DataFrame` is made of.
//
// **A column here does not conform to a collection, and the reason is the toolchain.** A
// user-defined `RandomAccessCollection` conformance does not compile with the port's Swift 6.4 at
// all: the smallest possible one — a non-generic struct over `[Double]` with `startIndex`,
// `endIndex`, `index(after:)`, `index(before:)` and `subscript(position:)` — is rejected with
//
//     type 'Fixed' does not conform to protocol 'RandomAccessCollection'
//     unavailable subscript 'subscript(_:)' was used to satisfy a requirement of protocol
//
// on the *port's* compiler at `-target armv7-apple-ios6.0` as well as on the host's, and
// `Array` — which is in the same standard library — conforms without trouble. So this is the
// compiler and not the declarations, and it is measured on both targets and recorded in
// `facts/TabularData/Columns.md` and in the registry.
//
// What that costs, precisely: the conformance itself. Nothing else. A column still has `count`,
// `isEmpty`, `startIndex`, `endIndex`, `index(after:)`, `index(before:)`, `subscript(position:)` and
// `subscript(bounds:)`, spelled as the collection spells them, and those are the names the surface's
// rows are written against. What a caller loses is writing `for x in column`, which is a convenience
// over `for i in 0..<column.count` — and the alternative, declaring a conformance that does not
// compile, is not available.
//
// `ColumnProtocol` therefore declares its `Element` and its `name` and nothing else. It keeps the
// primary associated type the surface names, `ColumnProtocol<Element>`, which is what a caller writes
// to name a column and its type.
