// CoreML.swift — the Swift overlay of the shaped arrays, in a module named `CoreML`.
//
// CoreML is absent on the port's release: the class that gives the family its name,
// `MLMultiArray`, is in `registry/CoreML/absent_CoreML.json` and stays absent, and the CoreML
// package's own work is not in this tree. What CreateML cannot do without is one *enumeration* —
// `MLShapedArrayScalar`'s single requirement is `static var multiArrayDataType: MLMultiArrayDataType` —
// and that is header-only, so it is carried by the lift (rule R4) and re-declared nowhere.
//
// This file is the overlay of the *shaped array* types over that enumeration, and it is a real
// multi-dimensional array: a shape, strides in elements, and a row-major block of scalars. A tree
// fitted here produces one of these as its feature vector, which is what CreateML's estimators take.
//
// What is NOT here, and is absent rather than stubbed: `MLModel`, `MLMultiArray`, `MLFeatureValue`,
// `MLTensor` and the compute-plan family. Each is a class with methods that the release does not
// have, and an overlay that declared a type the port cannot answer for would be the exact silent fake
// the port's rules forbid. `facts/CoreML/ShapedArray.md` says the same thing from the other side.
//
// The row-major layout is the one the strides describe, and it is what a linear model's weights are
// already in: a design matrix of `rows x columns` has strides `[columns, 1]`, which is what
// `LinearRegressor` hands back, so the arithmetic that fitted it needs no copy on the way out.
//
// ## What is reused, and what is not
//
// The leading-dimension arithmetic below — the scalars an element of a given leading index spans, the
// flat offset of that index, and the flat range a leading range covers — is **taken from** TensorFlow
// swift-apis' `ShapedArray` (`Sources/TensorFlow/Core/ShapedArray.swift`, Apache-2.0,
// https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis), which computes exactly these three as
// `scalarCountPerElement`, `scalarIndex(fromIndex:)` and `scalarSubrange(from:)`:
// `shape.isEmpty ? 0 : shape.dropFirst().reduce(1, *)`. It is the part that every strided N-D array
// needs and the part that is easy to get subtly wrong, and it is the whole of what a row slice is.
//
// Three parts of that file are **not** taken, and `facts/CoreML/ShapedArray.md` says why:
// its `TensorBuffer`, which has a second storage mode holding a `TF_Tensor*` — a dependency on
// TensorFlow's C library, a second copy of arithmetic and a dylib this port does not have; its
// several hundred lines of aligned multi-line shape description, where a port needs a shape and a
// count in a log line; and its `RandomAccessCollection, MutableCollection` conformance, which is
// the shape this toolchain rejects and which the port's review just cost a wrong row and a process
// abort over (F3).
