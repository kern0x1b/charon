// ModelWriter.swift — a Core ML model of these estimators, as the schema's own protobuf.
//
// Apple's `.mlmodel` is a protobuf over the schema vendored in `packages/c/createml/proto/`, and
// **every field number below is read out of those files** rather than recalled:
//
//     Model                   specificationVersion = 1, description = 2, neuralNetworkRegressor = 303
//     ModelDescription        functions = 20, input = 1, output = 10, metadata = 100
//     FunctionDescription     name = 1, input = 2, output = 3, predictedFeatureName = 4
//     FeatureDescription      name = 1, shortDescription = 2, type = 3
//     FeatureTypes            oneof { int64Type = 1, doubleType = 2, stringType = 3, multiArrayType = 5 }
//     ArrayFeatureType        shape = 1, dataType = 2   (FLOAT32 = 0x10000|32 = 65568)
//     NeuralNetworkRegressor  layers = 1, preprocessing = 2
//     NeuralNetworkLayer      name = 1, input = 2, output = 3, oneof { innerProduct = 140 }
//     InnerProductLayerParams inputChannels = 1, outputChannels = 2, hasBias = 10, weights = 20, bias = 21
//     WeightParams            floatValue = 1
//
// **The model shape is a one-input, one-output neural network with a single inner-product layer**, and
// that is not a wrapper: for a row of features `x` the layer computes `bias + weights · x`, which *is*
// a linear model, and Core ML executes it as one. So an exported linear regressor is a model Core ML
// will load and predict with, and the differential proves it by loading it and predicting — which is
// what "exported" has to mean.
//
// `NeuralNetworkRegressor` carries the layers **directly** (field 1), not a nested `NeuralNetwork`, and
// that is the detail a hand-written writer gets wrong first: the older spelling nested a network and
// the current one does not.
//
// The estimators that are not linear are **not** written here. A tree ensemble is a different message
// with a different layer set, and a model file that says `NeuralNetworkRegressor` and carries a forest
// would be a model Core ML loads and answers with the wrong arithmetic. `write(to:)` on those throws
// `MLCreateErrorCode.cannotWriteModel` and says which kind is missing.
