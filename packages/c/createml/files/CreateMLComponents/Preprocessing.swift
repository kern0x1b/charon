// Preprocessing.swift — a preprocessor in front of an estimator, and the composed transformer that
// carries both.
//
// A pipeline is not a new algorithm. `PreprocessingEstimator(scaler, forest)` *is* a scaler and a
// forest, and what it adds is one thing: the fitted preprocessor travels **with** the fitted model, so
// a prediction goes through the very scaler the fit used. Without that a caller has to remember to
// scale new data by the training mean, and the first time someone forgets, the numbers are wrong and
// nothing says so.
//
// So the type is a pair plus a composition, and the fit is two fits: the preprocessor fitted and
// applied, then the estimator fitted on what came out. The `fitted(on:)` convenience runs both,
// because a caller who wants to look at the intermediate calls the halves and a caller who does not
// calls one.
//
// The eight names the framework has are this same shape over four axes, differing only in which
// estimator protocol the inner one answers to and whether it can be updated. `Updatable` is the same
// pipeline with one semantic added: an update touches the **inner** estimator and leaves the
// preprocessor as the fit left it, because refitting the preprocessor on the update's data changes
// the features the estimator was fitted on, and that is a different model rather than an update.
//
// Everything here is over `ColumnarTable` and `RowMatrix`, the two types this package already has. A
// framework's pipeline is written over `DataFrame` and `TabularTransformer`, and those are the shapes
// of the `DataFrame` work that is next; naming types here that do not exist yet would put a
// declaration in the tree that nothing can use.
