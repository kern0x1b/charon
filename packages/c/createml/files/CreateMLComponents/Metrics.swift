// Metrics.swift — a classifier's quality, counted one label at a time.
//
// The whole of this is counting, and the counting is done **incrementally**. A metrics object is
// something a caller fills row by row as a model predicts — a live model's confusion matrix, or a
// cross-validation fold — and a type that could only be built from two whole sequences would answer
// the question a caller has at the end and not the one they have at the thousandth row. So the
// counts are the state and every score is read from them.
//
// What is counted, per label, and what each count means:
//
//   - `count(label:)` is how many rows carry that label **as the answer** — the true count.
//   - `count(predicted:)` is how many rows were **predicted** as that label.
//   - `count(predicted:label:)` is how many rows were predicted as that label and are that label:
//     the true positives.
//   - and from those three, the other side of every coin: a true positive is one where they agree, a
//     false positive is a prediction of the label where the answer was something else, a false
//     negative is the answer where something else was predicted, and a true negative is the rest of
//     the rows.
//
// The scores are then the definitions, and the definitions are the whole of the difference between
// two numbers a caller might compute:
//   precision is the true positives over the predictions — of everything the model said this label
//   was, how much was right;
//   recall is the true positives over the true count — of everything that was this label, how much
//   the model found;
//   F1 is their harmonic mean, which is *not* their arithmetic mean: the harmonic mean punishes the
//   smaller of the two, and that is the point of using it.
