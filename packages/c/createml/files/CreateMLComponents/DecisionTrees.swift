// DecisionTrees.swift — a CART decision tree, and the two things it is built from: the split search
// and the stopping rule.
//
// A tree here is an ordinary CART tree over the columns of a `TabularTrainingSet`, and the split
// search is the one that is actually used: a numeric column is cut at the midpoint between two
// neighbouring sorted values, a threshold that admits no gap a value could fall into, and a
// categorical column is cut at a subset of its categories found by the same impurity criterion.
//
// The impurity is the one the criterion's name says. A regression tree's is the variance of the
// targets, so a split is chosen to maximise the fall in it, and the prediction is the mean of the
// rows that reach the node. A classification tree's is the Gini impurity, so a split is chosen to
// maximise the fall in it, and the prediction is the most common label that reaches the node, with
// the label probabilities carried alongside so a forest can average distributions rather than
// majority-vote labels.
