// Proximal.swift — the L1 penalty, which the ridge fit cannot reach.
//
// The L2 fit is a *linear* problem with a closed form: the normal equations, a Cholesky factor, done.
// The L1 fit is not — `|w|` has no gradient at zero, and the problem is a minimisation of a convex
// function over a ball rather than a system of equations. So it is solved iteratively, and the
// iteration is a **proximal gradient** one: FISTA, the accelerated version of ISTA.
//
// ## The step, and why it is `softThreshold`
//
// Given a smooth part `f` and an L1 penalty, the update at a point `w` with step `t` is
//
//     w' = softThreshold(w - t * grad f(w),  t * lambda)
//
// and the soft threshold is `sign(x) * max(|x| - l, 0)`. It is the **proximal operator** of
// `lambda * |.|`, and the whole point of the method is that taking that exact step on the *smooth*
// part and the exact prox on the *penalty* converges, where taking a gradient step on both does not.
// A gradient step on `|w|` is subgradient descent, and subgradient descent on an L1 problem converges
// at `1/sqrt(k)` — so slowly that a model with ten features and a `maxIterations` of 400 is nowhere
// near the answer, and the zeros it does reach are the ones it happened to overshoot.
//
// ## The acceleration, and when it is turned off
//
// FISTA adds a momentum term with a growing step, which on a strongly convex problem converges
// geometrically instead of at `1/k`. It is a *sequence* method, so `w` is the extrapolated point and
// `y` the point the gradient was taken at; the two are kept apart because taking the gradient at the
// extrapolated point is the whole of the acceleration. Momentum is **off when the problem is not
// strongly convex**, which for a penalty that is purely L1 it is not: FISTA's geometric rate needs a
// strong convexity that an L1 penalty destroys on the zero coordinates. The switch is `momentum` and
// it defaults to on for an L2 term, off for a purely L1 one.
//
// ## The step size, and why it is not the caller's guess
//
// The smooth part is quadratic here — `1/2n |X(Xw - y)|^2` for a regression, and the analogous
// logistic loss — so its gradient's Lipschitz constant is the largest eigenvalue of `X'X / n`, and
// the safe step is `1 / L`. That is computed by **power iteration on `X'X`**, using the device's own
// BLAS, rather than by a power-of-two backtracking schedule: the matrix is already built, one
// symmetric matrix-vector product is cheap, and a backtracking schedule would take twenty
// matrix-vector products to reach a step the eigensolver reaches in ten.
