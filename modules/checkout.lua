-- The repositories a package is built from, each at the commit its tag named when the package was written.
--
-- A tag that moved is not the release it names, so every clone is checked against its commit and the build stops when they
-- differ. The clones of a compiler or a runtime are gigabytes, so a source directory that already holds exactly these
-- commits is kept: an install that failed halfway, or a second architecture, does not pay for the download again. What the
-- last install changed in a repository - the patches it applied - is undone, so a build always starts from the release; a
-- build tree kept beside the repositories, rather than inside one, survives that and is the reason to keep them at all.
-- The stamp is written last, so a clone cut short is not mistaken for a finished one.
