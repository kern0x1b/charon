-- The digest of a Lua source that a recipe puts into its build hash. What only the reader sees, the comments and the layout
-- of code, is left out of it, so that rewording a comment or breaking a line is not a new build: a compiler or a runtime
-- rebuilt from source for that would be hours of work that changed nothing. Strings, which can hold a script or a flag,
-- count in full.
-- A recipe's description can read no file, so it cannot compute this: the digests live in a digest.lua beside each recipe,
-- which the recipe includes, tools/recipe-digests.lua writes, and a test checks against the sources.
