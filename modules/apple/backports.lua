-- The object store (opt.store): an object kept under a key of everything its compile reads that can
-- change, so that a build hands back an object it already has without starting a process. A ccache
-- hit is not that: it is a process, which hashes the preprocessor's inputs, stats every SDK header
-- it read and copies the object out - measured 30-60 ms a unit under the fleet's load, 2331 units a
-- gate at four cores, which was the whole of the 21-29 s every gate spent "compiling" a tree nothing
-- in had changed. The key is the compiler, its arguments with the checkout's own path taken out (as
-- ccache's base_dir takes it out, so every worktree shares one entry), the source, and every header
-- of the checkout the source reaches through #include/#import, by content. Headers outside the
-- checkout - the SDK, the compiler's own, an archive's include folder - sit under installdirs whose
-- names are the hash of what they hold, and are in the key through the paths in the arguments.
-- A directive the scan cannot read (a macro in place of a name) leaves the unit out of the store,
-- compiled every time as before. Reading a directive in a block the preprocessor skips only adds a
-- header to the key, which costs a rebuild and never a stale object.

-- The protocol metadata a framework carries, which the port does not: on Apple a framework's protocols are
-- in the framework, so NSProtocolFromString and -conformsToProtocol: work on a class an application never saw,

-- adopts is a row no build answers for, and check_registry holds it red (measured 2026-09-28: 73 such rows,
-- coordination/registry-gap-2026-09-28.tsv). So the build writes one object source per library per release
-- band - <Library>Protocols<release>.m - that names every protocol the band carries, which is what makes clang
-- emit __OBJC_PROTOCOL_$_<name> into the object. One file per band, so every symbol in it first appears in one
-- release and release-split has nothing to flag; one io.writefile per file, so no redirection can truncate it.
-- The protocols a folder's own objects emit the metadata object for, and which file emits each.
--
-- What makes clang emit __OBJC_PROTOCOL_$_<name> is a CONFORMANCE - an @interface or an @protocol whose
-- protocol list names it - and nothing else: importing the header that declares it, using id<name>, and
-- naming it in @protocol(name) all emit none of it. So the search is for a protocol list on a declaration
-- line and for nothing else, and each name is looked for inside such a list rather than in the file at
-- large, because a property of type id<name> or NSArray<name *> mentions the name in a line with no
-- declaration in it and would be a second, wrong answer.

-- CoreML's MLFeatureProvider.m emit __OBJC_PROTOCOL_$_MLFeatureProvider is in no source of this
-- repository. It is in Apple's MLFeatureProvider.h, where MLDictionaryFeatureProvider is declared as
-- conforming, and the port gets it by importing <CoreML/CoreML.h>. A search over this repository's sources

-- `-framework X` resolves through the SDK's own install-name for X, which is wherever Apple's
-- *current* release keeps it - not necessarily where the band being linked keeps it. JavaScriptCore
-- moved from /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks to /System/Library/Frameworks exactly at iOS 7.0
-- (measured against both ends of the covered range, the only one of this package's 21 frameworks
-- that did): a band before that point links fine because the SDK's path happens to still match iOS
-- 6's, and a band from 7.0 on embeds a load command for a path that release never carried, which
-- only shows up as a bare "which neither the device nor this build provides" at the import check,
-- far from the framework name that would explain it.
--
-- The fix cannot be stubs()'s: a .tbd built from only this band's own exports drops every symbol
-- a later release added that this band's code reaches through a weak, API_AVAILABLE-guarded
-- reference (UTType.m's calls to _UTTypeIsDeclared/_UTTypeIsDynamic, absent on every release this
-- package covers before 11.0, are exactly that shape) - the linker needs a *declaration* to bind
-- those weakly, and a band-scoped stub does not carry one for the same reason the band does not
-- carry the real definition. Answered instead by keeping the ordinary, full-declaration
-- `-framework X` link exactly as before (nothing loses a weak-import declaration it depends on),
-- and rewriting the one load command afterward with install_name_tool -change, from whatever the
-- SDK embedded to the path this band's own cache says the framework actually lives at - the same
-- fact stubs() already reads from the cache, applied to the framework itself instead of only the
-- symbols a band reexports from it. Not a JavaScriptCore special case: framework_install_path is
-- asked for every framework a library links, so the next one Apple relocates is caught here

-- neither `found.classes` nor `found.members` and every row spelled `-[P method]` was unbuildable however
-- much of P there was. Measured 2026-10-04 on the Metal 4 queue: the protocol transcribed, the class
-- conforming, `__OBJC_PROTOCOL_$_MTL4CommandQueue` emitted with its method list, and check_registry still
-- answered "listed as implemented, but nothing of that name is built" for all eight members and both
-- properties - the same finding the branch above records for a protocol with no image, and the same answer:
-- the row was right and the CHECK was blind.
--
-- **AND ONLY THE PROTOCOLS THE PORT DEFINES, which is the half that took a second measurement.** A protocol
-- record is per image, not exported: a linked library carries a `protocol_t` for every protocol it adopts OR
-- MERELY REFERENCES, so reading `inventory.protocols` whole counted the system's protocols as the port's. The
-- 6.1.3 gate on land-w19 answered "built, but no entry in registry/" for `-[NSObject retain]`,
-- `-[UITableViewDelegate tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:]`, `-[MPSNNPadding label]`, `-[CAMetalDrawable
-- layer]` and four hundred more, every one of them Apple's.
--
-- The test is the one this file already has for "the port declares it": `declared_protocols()` reads every
-- header the package installs and keeps a protocol declared WITH A BODY, dropping a forward declaration
-- because the SDK's umbrella supplies that body and a port that redeclares it declares nothing. Over the
-- package that is 47 protocols - its own `Charon*` ones and the transcriptions in the Charon*Protocols.h

-- whole release either: a public framework can ship as a file beside it (PushKit on 8.0 and 8.1.3),
