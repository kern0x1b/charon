-- The compiler cache every build in this tree can run its compilers through, and the two things
-- that differ between the callers: whether a run writes an object file, and whether its output is
-- wanted on stdout.
--
-- Why it is a module and not a function in one of its callers: the lift and the backports build
-- each run a compiler thousands of times, and they are the two callers whose cost that is. A second
-- copy of "find ccache on the path" is a second thing to keep right, and the rule against that is not
-- worth bending for the convenience of one caller.
--
-- Routed, so far: every clang the lift runs (seven call sites in modules/apple/lift.lua), and
-- backports.compile() itself. Not routed, and deliberately not a claim that they are cheap:
--
--   - lift.lua's swiftc runs. ccache does not drive swiftc, so there is nothing to route them
--     through; a Swift compile is cached or not by whatever the Swift build system does, and here
--     it is not.
--   - backports.lua's releases_in(), which runs one
--     `-fsyntax-only -Xclang -ast-dump-filter=<name>` per exported symbol of every object that
--     measured_introduced() could not date from the .tbd files - the same order of magnitude as
--     the lift's per-name loop, in the same shape (one umbrella, a per-symbol filter in the
--     arguments, so the key is stable), and left raw. It wants the same one-line change as the
--     lift's call sites and belongs in its own patch; nothing here is broken by leaving it, and a
--     reader should not conclude that the backports build has one compiler path. It has two, and
--     this is the one that is not cached yet.
--
-- What ccache changes is the cost of a compile, not its result: it runs the same compiler with the
-- same arguments, and on a hit it hands back what the compiler wrote for that same command. For a
-- run that writes no object - a lift's -fsyntax-only -ast-dump, or a header probe - it replays the
-- compiler's own output instead, and that was measured too: with clang's per-process AST node ids
-- normalised (they differ between any two runs, cached or not) the dump is byte-identical,
-- 5,370,418 bytes and 782 availability attributes both ways. The residual is the path spelling,
-- which is why backports.compile() takes its source absolute: the key is path-independent and the
-- object is not.
--
-- Where the key comes from is the machine's business: hash_dir = false in the cache's own
-- ccache.conf is what lets two worktrees share one cache, and coordination/heavy.sh writes it.

local cached_program

-- The cache program to run a compiler through, or nil where there is none to run it through.
-- CCACHE_DISABLE takes it out for a build that has to show its own work, and ccache reads that
-- variable as set-at-all, empty value included - measured: with CCACHE_DISABLE= set ccache records
-- no call, and with it unset the second identical compile is a direct hit. CCACHE names the
-- program where it is not on the path, and is checked as hard as one found on the path, so a
-- stale value left by a brew upgrade that moved ccache costs the cache and not the build. xmake
-- 3.1.1 has no os.which, so the path is walked here; the answer is kept, because a build runs a
-- compiler thousands of times and neither the path nor the environment changes under it.
