-- xmake l tools/registry-one-minimum.lua [--framework NAME] [ROOT]
--
-- The gate's 4.3 rule over a whole tree: an object is carried from one release on, and its minimum
-- is read from the entries the symbols it carries answer to, so within one object those entries all
-- name the same minimum or none of them names one. A set holding both none and a value, or two
-- values, is what minimums() refuses as misplaced. This prints those objects and exits 1.
--
--   NSURLSessionWebSocket13.m: ... rows name the minimums 5.0 and 6.0 - NSURLSession (5.0), ...
--   WKContentWorld14.m:        ... rows name the minimums 6.0 and none - WKContentWorld (6.0), ...
--
-- It is a tool and not a guard test on purpose. The rule is the gate's, and a guard that holds the
-- whole repository to it is red on objects the gate itself carries in a stack - four of them, none of
-- them in CloudKit. This reports them and leaves landing them to whoever owns the object.
-- tests/addon/registry_test.lua proves the rule on synthetic objects, which is where a rule of this
-- shape is settled, and calls the same offenders() this calls.
--
-- ROOT is resolved against the current directory and, failing that, against the PROJECT's own root,
-- which is where xmake found this project however the run was invoked - so an absolute ROOT and a run
-- from any directory of the project both land on the package. Reading nothing is never a clean bill of health: a run that read zero objects prints a
-- different sentence and exits non-zero, because "nothing is owed" and "nothing was read" must never
-- print the same line.
--
-- Objects are the files, so the grouping is by the file that DEFINES a class and never by the row's
-- `source` field: that field is a transcription, it can be wrong, and eight were - the rows of
-- CKSyncEngineConfiguration and of the six scopes, options and contexts named CKSyncEngine17.m while
-- CKSyncEngine.m and CKSyncEngineState17.m define them - which is how a check keyed on it reads clean
-- over an object the gate refuses. A class two files implement is carried by both, so both are asked.
