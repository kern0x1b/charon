-- vt-ladder-names.lua — measure a list of VideoToolbox constant names against the HELD CACHES.
--
--   xmake l tools/vt-ladder-names.lua <names file> [SDKDIR]
--   prints constant<TAB>release, or constant<TAB>- where no held cache exports it
--
-- WHY: ladder.tsv is read by place-by-ladder.py to place the port's 135 constants, and it used to be
-- built from the port's OWN objects. So it held those 135 and nothing else, and "the table says nothing"
-- could be read as "no held cache exports it" - two different claims, and 13 registry rows (the
-- kVTProfileLevel levels, which the release exports itself) were unaccountable for. The table must hold
-- EVERY constant row the registry has, each with a release or an explicit '-', and a row absent from it
-- is a failure rather than a silence.
--
-- IT CALLS THE SAME MODULE tools/release-split.lua CALLS and has no exports reader of its own:
--   dyld.held_ladder({"armv7", "armv7s"})   the real cache ladder, oldest rung first
--   dyld.first_releases(ladder, sdkdir, ...)  the first release that EXPORTS a symbol
-- A second reader is the two-implementations failure this family has produced four times, and the export
-- tries are exactly why a byte search cannot answer this: modules/apple/dyld.lua walks them.
--
-- TWO CONTROLS, because without them nothing it prints is a result: a symbol KNOWN to be exported at 7.0,
-- which must come back with a rung, and a name in no header and no cache, which must come back '-'.
