"""Does a regeneration of the Intents registry move anything but a reason?

The five counts are what the series holds — ios10 1029, ios11 288, ios12 100, ios16 465,
ios18 19 — and N3 is a change of *reasons only*.

The counts include the 83 extern constant rows, because the run being checked now restores them:
a regeneration that dropped them was measured dropping all 83 (716270c33), and the counts that
excluded them are the counts of the defect. This regenerates the
registry into a scratch folder and compares it with the committed one entry by entry: the same
files, the same names, the same kinds, the same statuses, the same introduced versions, and the
same set of fields apart from `reason` and `effect`. Anything else is a regression, and it is
reported by name rather than as a count.

    Usage: tools/intents/check-registry.py [--work <scratch>] [--counts-only]

Exit status is non-zero on any difference beyond a reason, and the difference is printed.
