"""Write the Intents registry from what the built code carries, not from a list.

An entry that says a member is implemented is worth nothing unless something checks it, and
modules/apple/backports.lua's check_registry is what checks it: it reads the classes, the
selectors and the symbols the package's libraries really export and refuses an entry that names
none of them. Writing eight hundred entries by hand would be eight hundred chances to claim a
member the library does not carry, so they are written from the generator's own report of what
it emitted, and every member the SDK declares and this delivery does not carry is written as
`absent` with the reason it is not there - a class of a later group of the same delivery, or a
header that marks the member unavailable - so that nothing is claimed in one direction and
missed in the other.

The rows come from the corpus (coordination/corpus/sdk-26.2-surface.tsv, the SDK 26.2 surface
after iOS 6.1); the `introduced` of each is the corpus's own, which is the availability the SDK's
headers give, and the release an object file is carried from is the one measure-intents.lua
measured against the armv7 release caches. The two disagree for one class of this framework
(INPaymentStatusResolutionResult: the header says 10.0, the caches say 10.3), and the caches
decide the object file while the header decides the entry, which is what each of them is for.

Usage:
    tools/intents/gen-registry.py --corpus <surface.tsv> --report <report.json>... \\
        --out <registry/Intents/ios10.json> --facts <facts/Intents/Intents.md> --release 10.0.1
