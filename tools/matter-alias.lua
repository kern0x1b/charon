-- `read/write/subscribeAttributeApple<Attribute>`, over the Aliro feature the open-source model declares under its own
-- name (measured: `AppleAliro` and `appleClearAliro` have zero occurrences in connectedhomeip master as well as in the
-- 1.6.1.0 this package builds, and master's templates/availability.yaml lists the names unprefixed). So every such row
-- is one selector forwarding to another over the same attribute or command id, and the forwarders are generated here
-- from the selectors the library actually carries rather than written out: a rename, and a rename has no per-row
-- judgement in it.
--
-- A target that the library does not carry is *not* emitted and is named here, because a forward to nothing is a
-- method that lies.
