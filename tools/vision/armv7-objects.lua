-- The armv7 objects of ONE library, compiled with the flags modules/apple/backports.lua's own
-- compile_arguments() produces for them, so that tools/release-split.lua and nm have something to
-- read for that library alone. The gate (coordination/build-gate.lua) compiles every library and
-- links every dylib; this is the seven files of one, in seconds, and it is what the Vision facts
-- page's member counts and release-split runs are measured from.
--
-- It is NOT a gate and does not replace one: it does not run the registry check, does not choose
-- bands, does not link, and writes no library. What it does is compile, and it does that through
-- backports.compile() rather than through a command line of its own, so the flags are the build's.
--
--   CHARON_ROOT=<checkout> xmake l tools/vision/armv7-objects.lua <library folder> <objects folder> <release>
--
-- <library folder> is relative to packages/a/apple-backports, or absolute -- an absolute path is
-- how one library's sources are compiled from somewhere other than the tree, which is how the
-- before-and-after comparison in facts/Vision/Absence.md section 7.2 was measured.
--
-- The resolve it reads is the machine's compiler, SDK and archives for a release; the file is keyed
-- by the tree that produced it, so a tree whose packages/ has moved since has no file of its own and
-- CHARON_RESOLVE names one. Whichever is read is printed, because a flag set that is not the one the
-- gate would use answers a different question than the gate does.
