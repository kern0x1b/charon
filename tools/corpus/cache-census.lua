-- A class-prefix census of the held armv7/arm64 caches, with a control in the same run.
--
-- Usage:
--   CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l tools/corpus/cache-census.lua <name-prefix> [release...]
--   CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l tools/corpus/cache-census.lua --selectors <name>...
--
-- `objc-inventory.lua` dumps every class and protocol of one cache. This answers the narrower
-- question a registry row's `source` usually has to settle - "does the release carry any name like
-- this?" - and it answers it in a form a reviewer can check without a second tool and without
-- trusting the number in a facts page. Per release it prints the images, the classes and the
-- protocols that name the prefix, and the cache path it read.
--
-- **The control is the point, and it is in every run.** A census that prints 0 is ambiguous: the
-- name may really be absent, or the reader may be looking at the wrong thing, and a zero cannot
-- tell those apart. So each release is read, and every one prints its image count, its class and
-- protocol counts and the names found - a rung that carries the name is the control that makes the
-- zero on another rung mean something. A run in which no rung finds anything is reported as
-- CONTROL FAILED, not as an absence: it is the reader that is wrong, and a row may not be written
-- from it.
--
-- `--selectors` asks the OTHER question, through the other reader: `objc.known_selectors` reads the
-- selector table, which is a different part of the image from the class and protocol metadata
-- `objc.inventory` reads. It is kept here because the two together are what settles a member row,
-- and because the second reader does not merely confirm the first - a selector belongs to no named
-- class, so a name it reports can be registered by something else entirely. Each release prints its
-- selector count and three controls (`-isEqual:`, `-description`, `-initWithFrame:`, which every
-- release has, and one name none has) beside the answers.
--
-- Releases default to the two the package deploys on (6.1.3 and 4.3, both armv7) plus 11.0
-- (arm64), the first held rung that carries CoreNFC: with the three, the facts page's own claim is
-- reproducible by pasting the command and nothing else. Name releases to read others; the
-- architecture is the one `dyld.held_ladder` picks for that release, so 16.0 and 18.0 are read as
-- arm64e and 11.0 and 12.0 as arm64 - a split that is silent otherwise.
