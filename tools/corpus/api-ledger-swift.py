"""
The Swift side of the API ledger: what the port's own built armv7 Swift modules actually declare.

Every Swift row of coordination/corpus/sdk-26.2-surface.tsv is left `unmeasured` by api-ledger.py
because no Swift pass existed. This is that pass, and it is one measurement: a module the port
builds for armv7 is read with `swift-api-digester -dump-sdk` (the toolchain's own API digester, run
against the built binary .swiftmodule) and every declaration it reports is indexed by its
`printedName` -- the same printed form the surface's rows were built from, so a row is placed by an
exact name comparison and nothing is matched by guessing.

What the evidence is, precisely, because it is weaker than the Objective-C side and the ledger must
not overstate it: a name in a built module proves the port's armv7 runtime *declares* it, and the
module's own dylib sitting beside it is what carries the code. It does not prove a function body
returns the right answer -- that is the generated call test's job, not this tool's. A name absent
from a module the port builds is measured `missing`; a row whose framework no built module stands
for is `undecided`, because nothing on this machine can place it.

A vendored reference interface is not a build and is not measured as one: Eidolon's
`bridge/fw/SwiftUI.framework` holds Apple's own 16.4 arm64 `.swiftinterface` (its own header says
`-target arm64-apple-ios16.4`, "Apple Swift version 5.8"), so it describes the API's shape and
nothing about what this port has. Pass it in and it is read as a reference, reported as such, and
contributes no `implemented` row.

Usage:
  python3 api-ledger-swift.py --out <dir> --sdk <iPhoneOS SDK> --vfs <lift vfs.yaml> \\
      --module-dirs "swift-runtime=/path/to/lib/swift/iphoneos,styx=/path/to/Combine's dir" \\
