-- Read the value of exported data symbols out of a real dyld shared cache.
-- Usage: CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l cache-value.lua <cache file> <symbols file>
--
-- The symbols file is one symbol per line, TAB-separated:
--
--   <symbol>	<4|8|p>	<p|->	<s|->	-- the symbol is named as C names it; the cache names it
--                                      -- with the Mach-O leading underscore, which is added here
--                                      -- and stripped again on the way out
--                                      -- the value's width in bytes ("p" is this cache's pointer
--                                      -- size), whether it is a pointer, and whether it points at
--                                      -- a constant string
--
-- The width and the pointer flag are the caller's to know, because they come from the C type of
-- the declaration that names the symbol; this reads bytes and reports what is there. For every
-- symbol some image of the cache exports, one line comes back:
--
--   <symbol>	<install>	<address>	<bytes as hex>	<u32>	<u64>	<f64>	<pointer>	<string>	<width>	<storage>
--
-- preceded by one `#cache<TAB><architecture><TAB><pointer size>` line.
--
-- and for every symbol no image exports, one line of dashes -- "this release does not have it" is
-- an answer, not a failure. The address space is the project's own cache reader
-- (modules/apple/dyld.lua, through open_cache), so a split cache and the slide a stored pointer
-- carries are handled by the code that already binds them, not by a second parser here.
