"""
The exported Objective-C constants' real values, read out of real dyld shared caches.

Which of the surface's `constant` rows are exported constants is not guessed: it is read from the
header pass's own per-framework index (api-ledger.py's cache). A row is an exported constant when
the lifted header declares it as a top-level variable -- an EnumConstantDecl is a depth-1 node and
is not in that index at all, so the two never mix. 6201 of the 20830 constant rows are exported
variables; the other 14622 are enum cases and carry their value in the header already.

The value is never invented and never taken from the SDK header. It is read out of a dyld shared
cache of a real release that has the symbol, oldest release first, through the project's own cache
reader (tools/corpus/cache-value.lua over modules/apple/dyld.lua): a release that already shipped
the constant is the release whose value it was. Which release each value came from is in the output,
next to the value. A constant no cache on this machine has is reported as such, with the releases
that were searched -- not guessed, and not filled in from the host framework, which is a different
platform with different values.

The width and the pointer/string reading of each value come from the declaration's own C type, with
the header's own typedefs resolved (`CFStringRef` -> `const struct __CFString *`, `CFIndex` ->
`long`), because a 4-byte read of a double and a pointer read of an integer are both wrong answers.

      --caches <release>=<cache file>[,<release>=<file>...] --out <output dir> [--jobs N]
