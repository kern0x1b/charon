"""
Tests for the corpus tools, for the three defects a review measured on the 0001..0004 delivery.

  1. `const-values.py` wrote a pointer's width as `0`, and `cache-value.lua` reads `0` as "read
     nothing", so every constant string came back empty.
  2. `cache-value.lua`'s symbols-file pattern was `(%d+)`, which cannot accept the `p` its own
     header documents as "this cache's pointer size".
  3. The surface scanner attributed `API_UNAVAILABLE(ios)` declarations -- tvOS's and visionOS's --
     to iOS rows, so rows that are not iOS APIs were in the denominator.

Each is pinned by a test that fails on the defect rather than asserting the fix in prose. 1 and 2
are checked end to end against a real dyld shared cache, because the defect was in the contract
between two programs and only a round trip catches it. 3 is checked against the walk's own output
for a declaration that really is marked that way.

    header-only C API was placed `missing` and 640 functions Apple never exports were handed out as
    work. Measured on the real compiler's own output, never on a string the test made up.

    The shape is Spatial's. `SPATIAL_INLINE` is `static inline` (Spatial/Base.h:34), the DECLARATION
    carries it, and the DEFINITION hundreds of lines later is preceded by the refined-for-swift and
    overloadable attributes only. clang 23.1.1 prints the declaration
    `static inline internal-linkage` and the definition `implicit-inline internal-linkage` - no
    `static` token on that line, and `implicit-inline` hyphenated where `" inline"` looks for a
    space - so the scan that read a keyword and kept the last line per name saw (extern, static) as
    (false, false) for all 640 and the classification's `if is_extern or not is_static` sent every
    one of them to `missing`, "the port has to export it".

    Two reads are pinned and neither is sufficient alone, which is why both are in scan_storage: the
