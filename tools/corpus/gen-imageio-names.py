"""Write the ImageIO name constants the port does not carry, one object per release, and their registry rows.

    python3 tools/corpus/gen-imageio-names.py [LEDGER]

WHAT IT MEASURES ITSELF, so a reader does not have to take the output on trust:

  1. every value, with the HOST's own ImageIO over dlsym, one process per symbol, by compiling and running
     tests/backports/host/imageio-names/probe.c.  Eleven of these names are not their own name -
     kCGImagePropertyAVISDictionary is "{AVIS}", kCGImagePropertyGroupMonoscopicImageLocation is
     "GroupImageIndexMonoscopicImageLocation", the two TIFF position names are "XPosition" and "YPosition",
     and the monoscopic locations and the stereo aggressor keys are bare words - so no naming convention
     produces this table.
  2. for every name, the first HELD RUNG that exports the SYMBOL, with tools/cache-index/first-rung.py.
     This family exports real `const CFStringRef` variables, so an object's API arrived in one release and
     this is what says which; a name no rung carries is placed by the ledger's own availability, because
     the ladder ends at 10.3.4 and nothing else says anything about it.

It writes packages/a/apple-backports/Graphics/ImageIONames<TAG>.m and
packages/a/apple-backports/registry/ImageIO/names<TAG>.json, one pair per release, and adds the objects to
tests/backports/host/imageio-names/objects.txt with the totals that harness pins in expected.txt.

// The same family holds both shapes, so no rule picks the right one and the measurement is the only thing

//
// A name is plain data - a caller looks a metadata key up with it - so the port answers it itself and the
// release is never asked. They are const CFStringRef like every other in this family.
