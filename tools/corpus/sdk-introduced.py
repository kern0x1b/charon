"""Dump SDK-declared API -> (kind, introduced) per framework by reusing surface-diff.declared()
(clang -ast-dump over the Mac Catalyst SDK). Output: corpus/sdk-introduced.json

    sdk-introduced.py --sdk <path to an iPhoneOS SDK> [--out FILE] [--frameworks A,B] [--no-swift] [--no-include]

takes a real iPhoneOS SDK whole instead: every framework that has headers is walked with clang
(objective-c, C), every C library under usr/include (os, dispatch, xpc, mach, sys, libkern, ... one
"framework" named include/<directory> each, `include` for the loose top-level headers) is walked the
same way, every module that has a .swiftinterface is read by swiftinterface-surface.py, and
what comes out is one row per declaration with its whole availability, not the (kind, introduced)
pair above: name, framework, kind, language, introduced, deprecated, obsoleted, unavailable, via.
`via` says where `introduced` came from: own, container (class, protocol, category or enum), class-floor
(the class of a category with no annotation of its own) or none; container and class-floor are a floor,
the member arrived in that version or later. The file also carries `dropped`, the count and the names of
everything the walk sees and does not turn into a row. The
default output is corpus/sdk-<version>-declared.json; sdk-introduced.json is left as it is, its
readers (crash-demand.py and the others) expect the shape above. The run is one clang per
framework, sequential: start it through coordination/heavy.sh.

Two things this does beyond a bare re-export of declared():

- A member with no @available of its own falls back to its containing class's or protocol's own
  resolved version, inside surface-diff.declared() itself (Surface.container_version) - this was
  already there, not added here. What was broken was reaching it at all: the generator's own
  import pointed at a worktree (.claude/worktrees/priceless-kepler-a7622c) that no longer exists,
  so every run needed SURFACE_DIFF set by hand or it did not run - and when sdk-introduced.json
  goes missing, crash-demand.py loses ~700 rows to `continue` with no count, silently, because a
  KeyError deep in ver() looks nothing like "the generator never ran". Fixed by preferring a
  local, already-current copy (surface-diff-latest.py, right beside this script) over the dead
  worktree, with SURFACE_DIFF still the first choice for whoever wants to point it elsewhere.

- A member that still has no version after that fallback - neither its own nor its container's -
  is checked against a real iPhoneOS SDK's declared() for the same framework, and named in
  corpus/sdk-introduced-unverified.tsv when absent there, rather than dropped outright.
  Measured against -[UINavigationBarDelegate navigationBarNSToolbarSection:], the concrete
  example this fallback was asked to filter as Catalyst-only ("NSToolbar is not in iOS at all"):
  it IS real iOS API, since iOS 16, per the iPhoneOS 16.4 SDK's own header text - just
  unannotated in both SDKs, the same as an old pre-@available method like
  -[NSURLConnectionDelegate connection:didFailWithError:] (iOS 2.0). "Absent from the one local
  iPhoneOS SDK" does not distinguish those from a real, genuinely Catalyst-only member (an
  AppKit-shaped extra the macabi target parses because Catalyst hosts it and real iOS never
  does) - it also matches ordinary newer API the local SDK, capped at 16.4, simply predates.
  Checked directly: -[CBCentralManagerDelegate
  centralManager:didDisconnectPeripheral:timestamp:isReconnecting:error:], a real iOS 17
  CoreBluetooth addition, is unannotated in the Catalyst dump AND absent from the 16.4 SDK - the
  same shape as the Catalyst-only case, with no way to tell them apart from this AST alone. An
  automatic drop on that signal would have silently discarded real API exactly the way this whole
  effort exists to stop; the two categories are named to the file above for a human decision, not
  merged into one guess.
