"""
The API ledger: a MEASURED status for every row of coordination/corpus/sdk-26.2-surface.tsv at
iOS 6.1.3, read from built artifacts. The surface's own `registry` column is carried through
untouched, and apple-backports' registry -- the one this ledger exists to check -- places no row of
any kind. A Swift row may be placed `declared` from
a *Swift package's own* registry when no built armv7 module for it is on this machine to check it
against; that is a record of intent, not a measurement, which is why it is its own status and its
own column.

status, one per row:

  implemented  the row's run-time symbol is there: a built apple-backports dylib of the port's
               own 6.1.3 gate carries the class/method/property, or the symbol is exported by the
               release's own 6.1.3 dyld shared cache (so the release already ships it).
  header-ok    the row is header-only -- a type, an enum case, a static or inline function -- and
               its declaration is present in the LIFTED 26.2 headers with no iOS availability that
               gates it past 6.1.3. The port needs no code for it: once the lift has lowered the
               availability, it exists.
  missing      measured as not there: no class, no selector, no symbol, or a declaration the lift
               still marks as introduced after 6.1.3 (an availability that was not lowered), or
               NS_UNAVAILABLE in the lifted headers.
  undecided    this tool cannot place the row, and says why. It is never a guess.
  unmeasured   the row is Swift-only and the Swift pass is not written yet (see below).

The three things a row is measured against:

  1. the built 6.1.3 libraries   a gate run's lib*Backports.dylib: ObjC metadata through
     tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua (the driver's own apple.objc reader), exported symbols
     through `nm -gU`.
  2. the release's own cache     ~/.charon/dyld/<release>/dyld_shared_cache_armv7: the same ObjC
     reader over the whole cache, plus tools/corpus/dump-cache.lua for its exports. A row the
     release already ships counts as implemented -- it works on the release.
  3. the lifted headers          one clang -ast-dump per framework, target armv7-apple-ios6.1.3,
     -isysroot the real 26.2 SDK and -ivfsoverlay the lift's vfs.yaml, walked by the same
     surface-diff-latest.py that built the surface: umbrella first, then every other header of
     the framework (an umbrella leaves public headers out), one translation unit, and one per
     header when the lot does not parse. This is where the header-only rows are placed.

Swift rows (lang=swift, 65145) are measured by api-ledger-swift.py, which reads the armv7 Swift
modules the port builds with the toolchain's own swift-api-digester and indexes every declaration by
its qualified name (`--swift-modules swift-modules.json`). A row is `implemented` when that name is
in a built module, `missing` when its own framework's module is built and the name is not in it, and
`undecided` when no module this port builds stands for the framework at all -- a vendored reference
interface is recorded as what it measurably is and contributes nothing. Without `--swift-modules`
those rows are `unmeasured`, which is what they were before that pass existed.

    name carries -- one, or both where the name is in both inventories, which is the ordinary case for
    a class the port only extends with categories (NSObject: the port's own categories plus the
    device's own, both measured, and the caller names whichever of the two has the selector). `stopped`
    is the recorded superclass the walk could not measure -- a name in neither the built libraries nor
    the 6.1.3 cache -- or "" when the walk reached a root or answered the row.

    A member is answered from up the chain only where the ancestor that answers it is measured at the
    release the row is measured for, and the caller's reason names the inventory that has the
    selector. That is the whole of the rule -- the port's classes are linked beside the device's, so a
    port class whose declared superclass is a release class inherits what the release declares, and a
    release class inherits up the release's own chain -- and it is why an ancestor in neither inventory
    stops the walk instead of being assumed to answer nothing.

    A name in the built inventory is not the port's own class: `load_built_inventories` merges every
    library that extends a class into one entry, so NSObject is "built" as soon as one library adds a
    category to it, and the entry then holds the port's selectors and no other. The pair is kept apart
    for that reason, and a `-init` found on the device's NSObject is reported as the release's.

    The owner itself is not in `chain`: the caller has already looked in its own selector sets. The
    walk follows the `superclass` edge `load_built_inventories` records per class, and `seen` is what
    makes it terminate on a chain that loops back on itself, which no measured inventory has and which
    is not this reader's to assume away.

    class-scoped-rows.py walks a chain as well, for its own question: one release at a time, out of
    its own inventory line format, with no built/release split to name. This one is asked which of two

    carrying that API. Looking only at classes read `-[CLLocationManagerDelegate
    locationManager:didDetermineLocation:error:]` missing while the 6.1.3 cache declares it.

    One selector is answered without the owner declaring it: `+new`. It is NSObject's, and every
    class inherits it -- measured in the release's own 6.1.3 cache, 2 of 11378 classes declare
    `+new` in their own metaclass list (NSObject and _PFCachedNumber) and 11376 inherit it, so a row
    whose owner is a class that does not declare it reads "selector new is not" for a selector the
    release carries. The port's own libraries do not declare it either, and do not need to: they are
    loaded beside the device's libSystem, whose NSObject has it. `decided` holds the rows a registry
    has decided, and this never applies to one of them -- `+[VNFaceLandmarkRegion new]` is answered
    by NSObject's `+new` only to call the class's own NS_UNAVAILABLE `-init`, which is a measurement
    somebody took, and an inference from the release's metadata does not overrule it. Protocols are
    not reached this way: a protocol has no metaclass chain to inherit from.

    A member a superclass implements is answered from up the chain, which no own table can see: the ten
    UIKeyCommand rows are the measurement. The built 6.1.3 image holds `UIKeyCommand` with superclass
    `UICommand`, and `UICommand` declares `-action`, `-title` and
    `+commandWithTitle:image:action:propertyList:` while `UIKeyCommand` declares none of them, so all
    ten read "selector X is not" for members the port carries.

    The walk is LAST -- after the owner's own sets, the protocols and `+new` -- so nothing that reads
    implemented today can read anything else: only a row that read missing moves, and only to
    implemented.

    It is also held back by two facts about the row, for the reason `+new` gives: a row a registry has
    decided, and a row Apple's own header marks NS_UNAVAILABLE, are not answered by an inference from
    the release's metadata. Measured on the whole surface, the first is 13 rows -- ten
    `-[VN*Request init]`/`initWithCompletionHandler:` whose registry row says Apple's own header marks
    the initialiser unavailable, two `UITextInputTraits` properties the port answers on NSObject under
    a row of its own, and `+[NSURLSessionStreamTask new]`. The second is 59, and it holds the two
    UIKeyCommand factories this walk was written for: UIKeyCommand.h:108 and :113 mark
    `+commandWithTitle:image:action:propertyList:` and its `alternates:` form NS_UNAVAILABLE, so a
    program that names them does not compile and no release answers them. The eight UIKeyCommand
