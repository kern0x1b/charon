Does a property row whose owner is a protocol get read as missing while the protocol declares it?

A property row's owner is named without saying whether it is a class or a protocol, and the
surface has both. classify_method has searched classes and protocols since the 2026-09-27 review
(`-[CLLocationManagerDelegate locationManager:didDetermineState:forRegion:]` read missing while
the 6.1.3 cache declared it); classify_property did not, so every property of a protocol read
missing. Over the 145245-row surface at 6.1.3 that is 423 rows whose owner is a protocol and no
class, of which 383 are answered by that protocol's own selectors.

The accessors are what is looked for, in both selector sets, because a `@property (class,
readonly)` is read through a class method and never through an instance one.

    python3 selftest-api-ledger-property.py

Exit 0 when every check holds. The inventories are written here, so nothing on this machine can
make it pass or fail.
