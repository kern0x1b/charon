-- Count, over every class of a real dyld shared cache, the classes whose OWN method list carries a
-- selector. Two lists are counted separately, because the reader stores a selector under one key in
-- both of them and a search that does not know that answers 0 for a selector that is really there.
--
--     CHARON_ROOT=<worktree> xmake l class-selector-census.lua <cache> <selector> [image substring]
--
-- `<selector>` is the key **as modules/apple/objc.lua stores it**: `method_list` writes
-- `names["-" .. name]`, so an instance method and a class method of the same name share one key and
-- the two lists are the only thing that tells them apart. Asking for `new` or `+new` answers 0 in
-- every class of every cache, which is not a finding about the world: it is the shape of the key.
--
-- What is counted is a class's own list plus any category any image of the cache adds to it, and NOT
-- the superclass chain: `collect` in modules/apple/objc.lua reads `data.methods` and the metaclass's
-- `methods` and never walks a superclass, so a class that inherits a selector does not own it and
-- does not appear here. That is the distinction a `+new` question needs, because `+new` is NSObject's
-- and is inherited rather than redeclared by almost every class in a cache.
--
-- Output, one line per class that owns the selector in the list named, then the two counts:
--
--     #cache   arm64e
--     class    <name>  <image>  own=<instance|class|both>
--     #own instance <n>  class <n>  both <n>  of <total> classes
--
-- The control is in the output and not in this comment: the two counts are printed whatever they are,
-- and a run whose `class` count is 0 for a selector a release is known to define has found a defect in
-- the search, not a fact about the release.
