// air2cpu — a Metal compute kernel in AIR, turned into C the port can run on the CPU.
//
// A sibling of tools/air2es, and the same shape in every way that matters: it reads the AIR bitcode of a
// Metal library with LLVM, finds the functions that are kernel entry points, and writes something the
// port's runtime can execute. Where air2es writes a GLSL shader for an ES 1.00 compiler, air2cpu writes C
// for the application's own compiler, because the drivers of iOS 6 are OpenGL ES 2.0 and there is
// nowhere to dispatch a kernel into (facts/OpenGLES/ES3Functions.md, measured on an iPhone 4S).
//
//     air2cpu MODULE.bc OUT.c
//
// OUT.c is one translation unit holding every kernel it could translate and a table of them. A kernel it
// cannot translate is **refused by name**, on stdout, with the reason and the function: a kernel that
// answers the port's documented error is not a wrong answer, and a kernel that is translated wrongly is.
// The refusals are listed at the end of this file's own README section below.
//
// What a kernel looks like, read out of the AIR Apple's own compiler produced (and not from the header):
//
//   * buffers are `ptr addrspace(1)` carrying "air-buffer-no-alias";
//   * the thread identifiers are plain `i32` parameters — tid, gid, tg — because the compiler has
//     already lowered Metal's thread-position builtins into them;
//   * threadgroup memory is `ptr addrspace(3)`, a block the caller owns and hands in;
//   * a barrier is `air.wg.barrier(mem_flags, barrier_id, ...)`.
//
// Two spellings of "this is an entry point", because there are two: a library Apple's `metal` tool built
// marks its kernels in the named metadata `air.kernel`, and a library Metal's *runtime* compiled from
// source — the one tests/backports/host/air2cpu/oracle.m writes, by -[MTLDynamicLibrary
// serializeToURL:error:] — marks them with nothing at all, so they are the top-level functions that
// carry no stage marker. Both are recognised, and a library with neither is refused as a whole.

// The signature the port's runtime calls every kernel through, whatever the kernel's own parameters are:
// the buffers it was given, the three thread numbers, and the threadgroup block. A kernel without a block
// takes a null one.
// A kernel's barrier is a rendezvous of the threads of its workgroup, and the dispatch is what knows
// how its threads meet, so the barrier is a function the dispatch hands in. A group run on one thread
// has nothing to order and passes a null one; a group run across threads passes a rendezvous that
// waits. Neither is a stand-in: the ordering the kernel asks for is the ordering it gets.

    // an atomic must never be.
    // The order Metal's own compiler emits, read out of the AIR of the fixture's kernels.
    //
    // MEASURED, and the measurement is smaller than it looked. Metal's own diagnostics say, for every
    // atomic overload that takes no mem_flags argument: "candidate disabled: 'order' argument must be
    // 'metal::memory_order_relaxed' if no 'mem_flags' argument is provided". A DEVICE atomic can
    // therefore only be written relaxed, and relaxed is the only code a device atomic can carry. The
    // code the compiler emits for it is 1, and the two atomic kernels in the differential - sixteen
    // threads each racing to add one to a device counter - agree with Apple's own Metal on all 64
    // values, which is the proof that 1 is relaxed and not an assumption.
    //
    // The THREADGROUP family is the one that takes a mem_flags argument, and it is the one that can
    // carry the other orders; those codes are NOT MEASURED yet and are not in this table. A code this
    // port has not seen is refused, because an atomic answered with the wrong ordering is a kernel
    // stronger or weaker than the one the application compiled, which is the one thing an atomic must
    // never be.
    //
    // What is NOT the order, so the next reader does not spend the afternoon on it: the argument this
    // table used to read is not the order at all. A relaxed THREADGROUP load and a relaxed DEVICE
    // store differ in it - 1 and 2 - while both are relaxed, so the field is something else (a scope),
    // and the order is a different argument that is 0 in both. Reading the whole argument list of one
    // of each side by side, and of a threadgroup atomic written with an explicit mem_flags (the one
    // form that accepts all four orders), is what identifies it.
    //
    // The table is fitted to what the differential has PROVED, and nothing beyond it: a relaxed
    // fetch-add of a device counter is code 1 and nothing else is mapped, because the two atomic
    // kernels in the differential - sixteen threads each racing to add one - agree with Apple's own
    // Metal on all 64 values with it and did not with any other code tried.
    // The ORDER and the SCOPE, both settled by measurement rather than by inference.
    //
    // The settling measurement, in orders/settle.metal: the SAME atomic written twice with everything
    // held fixed but the mem_flags argument - a threadgroup atomic with mem_threadgroup and with
    // mem_device, and a device atomic with mem_device and with mem_none. In all four pairs ONLY THE
    // LAST FIELD before the i1 flag moves:
    //
    //   local.add.u.i32  (ptr, value, 0, 1, 2, i1)   mem_threadgroup
    //   local.add.u.i32  (ptr, value, 0, 1, 1, i1)   mem_device
    //   global.add.u.i32 (ptr, value, 0, 2, 1, i1)   mem_device
    //   global.add.u.i32 (ptr, value, 0, 2, 0, i1)   mem_none
    //
    // So the LAST field is the scope - 2 threadgroup, 1 device, 0 none - and the field before it is
    // the order, which is the field that varies with the order: measured on five threadgroup
    // fetch_adds whose only difference is the order, 1 relaxed, 2 acquire, 3 release, 4 acq_rel,
    // 5 seq_cst, cross-checked on an or, a max, an xchg, a load and a store.
    //

    // and a relaxed DEVICE operation carries 2. One table over both numbers is what had the tool
    // reading a device operation's relaxed as an acquire - which a C atomic store may not take, so
