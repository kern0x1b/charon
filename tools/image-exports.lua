-- xmake l tools/image-exports.lua RELEASE ARCHITECTURE INSTALL_SUBSTRING [SYMBOL_SUBSTRING]
--
-- Every symbol one image of one release's shared cache exports whose name contains SYMBOL_SUBSTRING,
-- read from that image's own export trie through modules/apple/dyld.lua.
--
-- This is the check a whole-cache search cannot make. "Is AVAssetWriterCreateWithURL in the 6.1.3
-- cache?" has answer "no" whether the constructor was never compiled for that slice or is exported
-- under a spelling a search for the public name misses -- and on 6.1.3 the AVFoundation image
-- exports 75 symbols matching "AssetWriter" of which every single one is an _OBJC_CLASS_$,
-- _OBJC_METACLASS_$ or ivar symbol, which is a different fact from "the class is missing" and the
-- one that decides whether the public writer API can be used at all.
--
-- INSTALL_SUBSTRING picks the image(s) by install name (e.g. "AVFoundation.framework/AVFoundation",
-- "libIOAccessoryManager"); SYMBOL_SUBSTRING picks the symbols within it, and an empty
-- SYMBOL_SUBSTRING lists all of them. The image's total export count is printed either way, because
-- "0 of 1731" and "75 of 75" say very different things.
--
-- Usage:
--   xmake l tools/image-exports.lua 6.1.3 armv7 "AVFoundation.framework/AVFoundation" "AssetWriter"
--   xmake l tools/image-exports.lua 6.1.3 armv7 "IAPAuthentication.framework"
