-- Every name one rung of the dyld ladder carries, one per line on stdout, for
-- tools/cache-index/build.py to sort, compress and key. SOURCE is what dyld.held_source() names for
-- the release: the file dyld_shared_cache_<arch>, or a libraries_<arch> folder beside it.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS: the first held rung of a name was found by running
--     strings -a CACHE | grep -xF NAME
-- over every rung, once per name, per slice, per author. That reads the whole cache per name
-- (measured 6 ms per MB: 0.42 s at 80 MB, 1.38 s at 233 MB, 6.04 s at 1002 MB, so ~148 s for one
-- name over the whole 24.6 GB ladder). Reading each cache ONCE and answering from an index is the
-- whole point; this script is that one read.
--
-- WHAT IS REUSED, not reimplemented: every byte of Mach-O and shared-cache parsing comes from
-- modules/apple/dyld.lua (open_cache, load, and the export-trie and symtab readers it exports) and
-- modules/apple/macho.lua (read, images, image() -- which is what fills .sections/.symtab/.strtab).
-- The new code is two loops: one that walks .sections and takes the NUL runs, which is the walk
-- modules/apple/macho.lua's text_literals() already does for a __TEXT,__cstring of a plain binary,
-- and one that takes a whole symbol table, which is the walk dyld.lua's own cached_library() already
-- does over the EXTERNAL range only. Neither is a second parser: both call the code above them.
-- text_literals() is not called because it takes a binary path and reads the whole file as one
-- image, which is not what a shared cache is (its header is dyld_v1, and its images sit at the
-- addresses the image table names).
--
-- WHAT IS INDEXED, and why each -- together a superset of what `strings -a | grep -xF` reports for
-- any real name, which is the property the self-test checks:
--   __TEXT,__objc_methname   every registered selector, which is where a selector name lives
--   __TEXT,__objc_classname  every class name, private ones included
--   __TEXT,__objc_methtype   type encodings, which authors grep when a name is a type
--   __TEXT,__cstring         C string literals: a selector built by sel_registerName() from a
--                            literal lives here, not in methname, and this is what strings read
--   the export trie          every EXPORTED symbol, through dyld.load()'s own reading, so the symbol
--                            half of a public name is the same reading tools/release-split.lua makes
--                            (export trie where there is one, external symtab otherwise, re-exports
--                            resolved)
--   the whole symbol table   every DEFINED symbol, public or private. This is not redundant with
--                            the trie: a private class is not exported, and measured on the armv7
--                            cache of 6.1.3 the trie alone misses 37313 _OBJC_ symbols that
--                            `strings -a` does report, among them _OBJC_CLASS_$_APKeychainUtilities
--                            and _OBJC_CLASS_$_APNetworksController. An index that answered NONE for
--                            those would be worse than the scan it replaces, so the symtab is read
--                            over its whole range and not only its external one.
--
-- BOTH SPELLINGS of an ObjC name are emitted, because authors ask for either: the mangled
-- _OBJC_CLASS_$_Foo and the bare Foo. One is the symbol a client binds, the other is the name in the
-- facts, and a lookup that answered only one would send someone to the other.

-- The sections a name can be written in, keyed by section name only: a cache carries one of each and
-- it is in __TEXT, and matching on the segment as well would silently skip a toolchain that moves one.
