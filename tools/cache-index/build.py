"""build.py - one name index per held release, read once each, and the merged table first-rung.py answers from.

    python3 tools/cache-index/build.py [--only RELEASE]... [--force] [--ladder armv7,armv7s]

The first held rung of a name was found by running

    strings -a ~/.charon/dyld/<release>/dyld_shared_cache_<arch> | grep -xF NAME

over every rung, once per name, per slice, per author. That reads the whole cache per name, which
measures 6 ms per MB on this machine: 0.42 s at 80 MB, 1.38 s at 233 MB, 6.04 s at 1002 MB, and so
~148 s for ONE name over the whole 24.6 GB ladder the workspace holds. With load at 19-22 several
authors were doing that at once, which is the bottleneck this tool removes.

This reads each cache ONCE, with tools/cache-index/names.lua (which reuses modules/apple/dyld.lua and
modules/apple/macho.lua for every byte of Mach-O and cache parsing), and writes

    $HOME/.charon/cache-index/<release>.names.gz     sorted, deduplicated, one name per line
    $HOME/.charon/cache-index/first-rung.tsv.gz      every name -> the first held rung that carries it

Each per-release file opens with one header line naming what it was read from and when, which is the
staleness key: a file whose header's mtime and size still match the cache is left alone, so a second
run costs 50 header reads and nothing else. A cache fetched again has a new mtime, and only a copy
that keeps both the size and the time of the file it replaces goes unseen - the same rule
modules/apple/dyld.lua's ladder_signature() uses for its own kept measurements, and the reason the
header carries both and not either.

THE LADDER IS THE PORT'S OWN. The rungs and their order come from dyld.held_ladder({"armv7","armv7s"})
in modules/apple/dyld.lua: for each release, the first of armv7, armv7s, arm64, arm64e that is held,
oldest first. Only the directory walk and that preference order are restated here, because this is a
python3 script and the ladder is Lua; the reading of a cache is not restated, it is called.

READ-ONLY TOWARDS THE CACHES. Nothing here writes under ~/.charon/dyld. The output is a separate
directory, so a sweep of that is a sweep of these and not of the firmware.

COST, so nobody runs this by accident: one process at a time, one release at a time, and niced. A full
cold build over the 50 held rungs reads 24.6 GB once and takes minutes; it is NOT a build, so it does
not go through coordination/heavy.sh, but it is not free either. Do not start it while the machine is
busy without nice (build.py renices itself and its child, which is why it can be run from a busy
session). Afterwards every lookup is a read of one small gz file.
