-- objc-method-imps.lua - what a release's own Objective-C methods DO, read out of a held dyld cache.
--
--   xmake l tools/objc-method-imps.lua <cache> <class>... [<Class>@<selector>...] [<0xaddress>...]
--
-- No switch of any kind: `xmake l` reads every argument that starts with a dash as its own and fails
-- on it (measured), so what the caller asks for is spelled in the argument itself - a class name reads
-- every method the class defines itself, Class@selector reads one of them down to the disassembly and
-- what that body names, and an address names the code sitting there.
--
-- apple.objc.inventory() answers which selectors a class carries and drops the address, because a
-- corpus row asks that. A row that asks what a method DOES needs the code, and a dyld shared cache
-- carries the code beside the metadata: method_imps() reads, in one pass, every method the named
-- classes define themselves with its unslid address and the bytes sitting there. This tool prints
-- them, and with a selector named it puts that body through clang and llvm-objdump and resolves what
-- the body names:
--
--   * a branch is pc-relative, and the object is assembled at 0, so what llvm-objdump prints plus the
--     body's own unslid address is the address in the cache;
--   * a cross-image call in a cache goes through a 12-byte stub no image owns - adrp x16, a page; add
--     x16, x16, an offset; br x16 - so the name of such a call is the name of what the stub branches
--     to, and the stub is read and asked about again. One level is all a cache stub has;
--   * a literal is an adrp page plus an add, and the cache is asked what is at the sum: a __cstring is
--     printed as the text it is, a __cfstring is followed to the bytes its pointer field holds.
--
-- Read-only: the cache is opened and closed and nothing under the cache folder is written. The object
-- files and listings go under .agent-work/runs/objc-method-imps, named from the directory above this
-- script so a rerun leaves its own evidence and nothing is read from /tmp.
--
-- One pass for the whole set of classes, because a pass costs minutes: measured 2026-10-03, 157s over
-- the cache of iOS 18.0 and 525s over the arm64e cache of iOS 16.0.
