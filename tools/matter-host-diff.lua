-- The host differential for Matter: what macOS's own Matter.framework carries, against the SDK 26.2 surface the
-- port implements, against what the port's own libMatterBackports.dylib carries.
--
-- The host's framework is in its dyld shared cache and not on disk, so the binary is written out first
-- (dyld.extract). Everything after that is read the same way the gate reads a library: the exports from the symbol
-- table, the classes and their selectors from the Objective-C metadata.
--
-- The three answers this exists to tell apart:
--
--   surface only   the SDK declares it, the host's framework has no such name, and neither does the port's. A row of
--                  the SDK 26.2 surface that no release of the framework carries, which is a row the port does not
--                  owe anything for.
--   host carries   the host's framework carries it and the port's does not: a row the port is missing, named.
--   port carries   the port's library carries it and the host's framework has no such name: either a row of a later
--                  SDK than the host's, or a name of the port's own. Both are said, not glossed.

-- The host differential for Matter: what macOS's own Matter.framework carries, against the SDK 26.2 surface the port
-- implements, against what the port's own libMatterBackports.dylib carries.
--
-- The host's half is read from a live process, not from a file. The framework is in the host's dyld shared cache and
-- is not on disk, and a binary written out of that cache (dyld.extract) does not carry the Objective-C metadata in a
-- form this repository's reader can walk - so the classes and functions came from its exports and the members could
-- not be read at all. tests/backports/host/matter/run.sh loads the framework into a process on this host and walks
-- objc_copyClassList, class_copyMethodList, class_copyPropertyList, class_copyProtocolList and
-- protocol_copyMethodDescriptionList, and asks the surface's function rows of the loaded image by name. That TSV is
-- the host's real surface, from the host's own runtime.
--
-- The port's half is read from its own library with the same modules the gate's check reads one with
-- (modules/apple/objc.lua, modules/apple/macho.lua), so the two halves are the same kind of reading and the comparison
-- needs no translation between them.
--
--   surface only   the SDK declares it and neither side carries it: a row of the surface that no framework of either
--                  kind has, which the port does not owe anything for.
--   host carries   the host's framework carries it and the port's does not: a row the port is missing, named.
--   port carries   the port's library carries it and the host's framework does not: a row of a later SDK than the
--                  host's, or a name of the port's own. Both are said, not glossed.
--   both           the same name in both.
--
-- The surface's constants are not in this comparison and are not a difference: they are header-declared enumerations,
-- so they live in the importing program and are not symbols either library exports.
