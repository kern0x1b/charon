"""Check which folder the driver takes for a built engine, and what it refuses.

engine_build is the one name a port imports to find its build, so a port keeps no
definition of a build tree of its own. These cases pin that definition: a tree is
a direct child of build/ that cmake configured and that has frameworks laid out,
and nothing else under build/ qualifies however much it resembles one.
