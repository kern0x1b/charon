-- A band below an object's registry minimum neither keeps nor re-exports it, so the minimum of each
-- object is read from the entries its names answer to: a registry with one function at 4.3 and one
-- at 6.0, a helper only the 6.0 object calls, and an installer that exports nothing and that nothing
-- names. For 4.3 the 6.0 object and its helper are left out and the installer is kept with no floor;
-- for 6.0 all four are kept. A helper the 4.3 object calls too is kept at 4.3. An object holding entries of two minimums is refused, and so is one whose
-- entries place it below an object it calls: it would not link in between. An installer that
-- calls into the 6.0 object takes its minimum, as it links only where that object is carried: the band
-- for 6.0 keeps it and the band for 4.3 leaves it out.
-- The rule tools/registry-one-minimum.lua enforces, on synthetic objects rather than on the
-- repository's: an object is carried from one release on, so every row of one object names the same
-- minimum or none of them names one, and a mix is what minimums() refuses. The test drives the tool's
-- own offenders() over a fixture built here, which is where a rule of this shape is settled - the
-- tool itself is not a guard test, because over the whole repository it is red on four objects that
-- are not ours and belong to whoever owns them.
--
-- The fixture is the two shapes the rule has to tell apart: CharonMixedA.m holds one row with no
-- minimum and one at 6.0, CharonClean.m holds one at 6.0 and one with none, and a class two files
-- implement is asked of both.

-- The registry is checked against what the backports carry only when every library
-- is built, so a library that no config of the package builds keeps that check from
-- running for every config, and nothing says so. The recipe names each library in
-- the list of links and again in the list it builds, and each config in both.
-- Every {…} that is a direct element of one of the recipe's two list-valued table.join(
-- calls, with the configs its own test names.  A list is one element of table.join(a, {…}, b,
-- {…}), so it is found by walking the text and taking the braces that are not inside another
-- table.  The test of a list is the run of package:config calls between the end of the
-- previous list and this one's "{"; it is empty for the lists the recipe adds with no test,
-- and {"FoundationBackports"} is one of those.
--
-- Reading the two apart is the point.  Counting a library's name and walking the *declared*
-- configs both pass on a clause that reads a config nothing declares: the name is there
-- twice and the config is never checked.  A whole library, and its rows, can sit in a
-- series and never be built, and this is the check that exists for that.
