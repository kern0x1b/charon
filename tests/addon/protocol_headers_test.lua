-- protocol_headers_test.lua: is every implemented protocol row of every library declared where that
-- library's generated protocol source can see it?
--
-- modules/apple/backports.lua's protocol_sources() writes one source per release a library's
-- implemented protocol rows arrived in, and each source opens with `#import "Charon<Folder>Protocols.h"`
-- and then names every row of that release with `@protocol(<name>)`. So a row with no declaration
-- reachable from that header is a source the 6.1.3 gate cannot compile, and nothing before it sees
-- it: the row is in the registry, the tool wrote the source, and the header is a file nothing reads
-- until a compiler does. That is what happened to UIKit's eight trait protocols, added with a
-- previous stack while CharonUIKitProtocols.h was last regenerated for another delivery.
--
-- A row passes when Charon<Folder>Protocols.h declares the protocol - forward (`@protocol X;`) or
-- with a body, which is what tools/transcribe-protocols.py writes for one the 16.4 SDK does not
-- declare - or when it declares it in a header that header imports by name. The imports are followed
-- inside the library's own folder and nowhere else, because that is where the generated source's
-- include path reaches, and an import of a header the folder does not hold is reported as well: the
-- same file that was supposed to supply the declaration would be the one the compiler cannot open.
--
-- A library with implemented protocol rows and no Charon<Folder>Protocols.h at all is a failure and
-- not a skip: the header is what its generated sources import, so its absence is the same defect with
-- no declaration to find.
