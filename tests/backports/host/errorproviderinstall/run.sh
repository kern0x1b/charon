#   ./run.sh mutant     the port's file with the install skipped, which must turn the verdict red
#
# The nineteen cases are the ones tests/backports/device/errorprovider.m asks on a device with the library
# loaded, and the answers they are held to are this Mac's own, as recorded by
# tests/backports/host/errorprovider/run.sh into device/errorprovider-expectations.h: the differential asks
# those same questions of NSError first, so a row that fails is the port and not a recording that drifted.
#
# The port's file is a category on a system class, so its selectors are renamed by prefix_selectors.py
# rather than by a -D, and the six methods are reached through the install pointed at a class of the test's
# own: +load cannot be exercised here, because this Foundation has carried the provider API since macOS 10.11
# and its +load returns without touching anything. The selectors the install replaces are the release's own
# spellings, and they are spelled as strings in the file on purpose - a rename that moved them would move
# the release's spelling with them.
