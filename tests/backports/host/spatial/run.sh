# run.sh - the host differential of the Spatial overlay, and the control that says it can fail.
#
# Two halves, and the second is the one that can fail:
#
#   the host half builds tests/backports/host/spatial/main.swift against Apple's own
#   Spatial.framework, which the macOS SDK carries as a swiftinterface and the running system
#   answers for;
#
#   the port half builds the same main.swift against the module this tree holds, compiled the way
#   packages/s/swift-runtime builds it: gyb first, then one unit per scalar with the recipe's own
#   flags. Every value on the right-hand side is therefore Apple's answer for the same input, and
#   check.py compares the two transcripts number by number.
#
# The differential guards nothing unless it can tell a mutation from itself, so one mutation of the
# module's own sources is run against it and the run fails if the mutant survives or does not
# build. A compiler error is a build failure and proves nothing, which is how the first attempt at
# this was measured.
#
# The compiler is the Swift 6.4.0 the package builds with (charon@swift 6.4.0), named rather than
# taken from PATH, and gyb is the one beside it: SPATIAL_SWIFTC overrides the first,
# SPATIAL_GYB_OVERRIDE the second.
#
# What this is not: a test of the module against itself, and not a check of the API's shape. An
# expression only one of the two modules can answer is not asked here; the two compiles are what
# measure that, and their output is in the commit message and in facts/Spatial/README.md.
