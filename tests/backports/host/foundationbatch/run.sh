# run.sh — the second N-Z Foundation batch against the system's own, in one process.
#
# Each source is compiled once plain, prefix_selectors.py renames the selectors it defines by their
# place in the AST, and the renamed objects are attached beside the system's Foundation through
# foundation2/host-attach.c. A category needs that mechanism rather than a -D rename, which would
# rename the same selector in an SDK header where it carries an attribute.
#
# Only the categories are in this build. NSProgress.m, the port's own NSProgress *class*, is not: the
# rewriter leaves a class implementation's methods unrenamed, so a host differential cannot hold that
# one beside the system's. tests/backports/device/foundation15batch.m holds its members.
