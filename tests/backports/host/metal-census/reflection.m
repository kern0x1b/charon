/* The type tree, read back: a round-trip against the property lists air2cpu wrote.
 *
 *     sh tests/backports/host/metal-census/reflection.sh PLIST [PLIST...]
 *
 * Two halves, and both matter:
 *
 *   * The READER is compiled from the port's own MTLTypeReflection.m - the same file the device
 *     builds - and run over real property lists: the one the invented fixture produces, and any the
 *     caller points at. It asserts what the file says: the arguments, their names, their accesses,
 *     the three the header has enumerators for, and the type of each.
 *   * The MUTANT is a scratch copy of the READER under .agent-work/runs/, with one change: it maps
 *     every access it does not recognise to read-write. That is the guess this port is not allowed to
 *     make, and the mutant must FAIL the same assertion the real reader passes.
 *
 * What this is NOT: it does not compare against Apple's kernels, and it asserts nothing about a
 * device. It is a host check that the reader reads what the writer wrote.
