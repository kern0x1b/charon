/* A differential for the two pieces of the MetalKit family that are pure arithmetic.
 *
 *     sh tests/backports/host/metal-census/run.sh
 *
 * Two things are checked, and both are the parts a mistake would hide in:
 *
 *   1. CharonMTKFlipRows, against a reference flip written out longhand here. The port's flip is the
 *      rows swapped end for end; the reference is the naive double loop that says the same thing the
 *      slow way. A flip that mirrored instead, or that dropped the middle row of an odd height, would
 *      differ from it and nothing else in the port would notice.
 *   2. The zone arithmetic of MTKMeshBufferAllocator: a zone of N bytes hands out windows that do
 *      not overlap, in order, and the first request that does not fit answers nil - which is what
 *      MDLMeshBufferAllocator's own words require ("Returns nil the buffer could not be allocated in
 *      the zone given").
 *
 * What does NOT run here, and why: the loader's own methods build a CGBitmapContext and an
 * MTLTextureDescriptor, and the mesh classes make an MTLBuffer from a device. Both need an EAGL
 * context this host has no more than the metalblit test has, and metalblit/run.sh already records how
 * this package handles that case - the part that is pure runs here, and the part that needs a device
 * is held to the device test. Neither piece fakes its way around that.
