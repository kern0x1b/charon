# check-protocol-rows.sh - every `implemented` PROTOCOL row must be declared in its library's
# Charon<Folder>Protocols.h, and this is the check that says so.

#     SELF_TEST=1 sh tests/backports/host/metal-census/check-protocol-rows.sh
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE. A registry row for a protocol is flipped by DECLARING the
# protocol, and a declaration is invisible to every other check: the class that adopts it compiles
# whatever the header says, and a missing declaration is a runtime nil rather than a build error. A
# stack-20 gate failed on exactly that, and the suite written to catch it - protocol_headers_test.lua
# and protocol-sources.sh - lives in the uikit-b-fin4 series and is NOT on main. So the rule had no
# check behind it here, and this is that check, written against the tree that exists now. When that
# suite lands it may well supersede this one; it does not become true by landing.
#
# It reads the REGISTRY, not a list written here, so a row cannot be flipped without this noticing.
