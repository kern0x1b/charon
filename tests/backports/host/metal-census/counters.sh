# Run from packages/a/apple-backports. THE PORT IS COMPILED WITH THE RENAMES AND THE CASE IS NOT.
# The port exports these eighteen under Apple's own names, because iOS 6 carries no constant of any
# of them; on this host Apple's Metal declares the same names, so the port's copies are renamed while
# they are compiled here and dlsym reads Apple's. Compiling the case with the renames as well would
# rename Apple's own declarations into the same names, which is a duplicate interface - and NOT
# renaming the port would bind the case's externs to Apple's and compare Apple's constant with itself.
#
# NO DEVICE IS EVER CREATED. These are strings; MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() hangs on a machine
# with no GPU, so nothing here calls it.
#
# A MUTATION THAT DOES NOT BUILD IS "RUN FAILED", NEVER RED, for the reason it is so in every
# harness in this directory: a mutation compiled with a wrong -I depth once left the previous binary
# in place and a green run was read off an object that no longer existed.
