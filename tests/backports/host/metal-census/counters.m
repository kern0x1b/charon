/* The 21 string constants of the 14.0 band, compared BYTE FOR BYTE against Apple's own constants.
 *
 * APPLE'S COPY IS READ WITH dlsym, NOT BY NAMING IT. If the case declared the twenty-one externs
 * and read them, the link would bind each name to whichever definition won - the port's or Apple's -
 * and a port that defined all twenty-one wrongly would be compared with itself and pass. So the case
 * opens Apple's Metal by path, dlsyms each name THERE, and reads the bytes of what it finds; the
 * port's value is read from the port's own definition. Two independent answers, compared.
 *
 * THREE ANSWERS ARE DISTINGUISHED, because two of them look alike in a boolean:
 *   - a name that is NOT THERE: dlsym returns NULL, and a planted name that does not exist proves
 *     the lookup can say so;
 *   - a name that IS there and holds NULL;
 *   - a name that is there and holds a string, whose LENGTH and BYTES are then compared. A
 *     comparison of pointer identity, or of the text alone without the length, would pass a string
 *     that is a prefix of Apple's.
 *
 * NO DEVICE IS CREATED. These are strings; a device is not involved and MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice
 * hangs on a machine with no GPU.
