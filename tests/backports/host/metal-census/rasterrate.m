/* The 13.0 rasterization-rate holders, measured against Apple's own objects where Apple answers.
 *
 * THERE WAS NO RUNTIME FAULT, and what hid it was a PRINT FORMAT. MTLSize is
 * { NSUInteger width, height, depth } - INTEGERS - and this case first printed those fields with %g,
 * so a width of 1920 was read as the DOUBLE whose bit pattern is 1920: 9.48606e-321. The round trip
 * was working throughout; the number was not. Every width and height here is printed and compared as
 * an unsigned long.
 *
 * TWO REAL DEFECTS WERE FOUND WHILE GETTING HERE, and both are in the port, not the print:
 *   MTLRasterizationRateLayerArray had no -init, so its NSMutableArray ivar was never created and
 *   -setLayer:atIndex: spun forever in its grow loop - a message to nil does not advance the count.
 *   layerCount is the LEADING CONTIGUOUS RUN of written layers, which is what Apple's own map
 *   answers; it is not the array's length. Both were measured against Apple and copied.
 *
 * WHERE APPLE IS THE ORACLE: the whole map, including the contiguous-run count - measured above.
 * WHERE IT IS NOT: the layer's own counters, which initWithSampleCount: is IGNORED for on a host
 * with no device and which then read back 9.88131e-324, so those two are compared against the
 * HEADER - the count a caller built the layer with - and not against an uninitialised value. There is
 * also a MEASURED DIVERGENCE that is recorded rather than asserted equal: Apple answers 0 for a
 * sample index past the end of a layer's array, where the header declares the element nullable and
 * the port answers nil.
 *
 * NO DEVICE IS CREATED. The port is compiled with the four classes RENAMED and this case is not.
