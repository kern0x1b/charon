#
# The reader is compiled from the port's own MTLTypeReflection.m - the same file the device builds -
# so this is a check of the reader and not of a copy. The mutant is a SCRATCH copy of that file under
# .agent-work/runs/, with one change: it maps an access it does not recognise to read-write. The port
# must never make that guess, so the mutant has to fail the assertion the real reader passes.
#
# The port's own header imports <OpenGLES/EAGL.h>, which the host does not have - the same wall
# tests/backports/host/metalblit/run.sh writes down, answered there with a stub, and answered here
# with the SAME stub directory rather than a second one. The reader under test does no OpenGL: it
# reads a property list, and it is the header's import that needs the stub.
#
# Where the plists come from: the invented fixtures under tests/backports/host/air2cpu/fixtures/ are
# read by this too, and any real property list the caller names. Nothing of Apple's libraries is
# asserted about here - no kernel, no name, no value.
