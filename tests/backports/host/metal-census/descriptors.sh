# Run from packages/a/apple-backports. ONE clang line builds the case TOGETHER WITH the port source,
# the way argbinding.sh does it: the device object and the host case cannot be linked together, and
# the failure looks like a missing main rather than a mismatched architecture.
#
# NO DEVICE IS EVER CREATED, and the case is built so that it CANNOT be: a descriptor is
# [[X alloc] init] on both sides, and MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() HANGS on a machine with no GPU.
# So the oracle is Apple's own object of the same class, and the port is compared to it property by
# property. The check below refuses a case that has linked a device, because a case that made one
# would either hang or be measuring something else.
#
# A MUTATION THAT DOES NOT BUILD IS "RUN FAILED", NEVER RED - the same rule and the same reason as in
# argbinding.sh: a mutation compiled with a wrong -I depth once left the previous binary in place and
# a green run was read off an object that no longer existed.
