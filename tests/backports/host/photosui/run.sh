# run.sh - the port's PhotosUI against the host's own, one answer per line, in two binaries and one
# comparison.
#
#   sh tests/backports/host/photosui/run.sh              # both sides, compared
#   sh tests/backports/host/photosui/run.sh --mutated    # one answer changed on purpose: it must fail
#   sh tests/backports/host/photosui/run.sh --recorded   # and both sides must still answer what answers/ holds
#
# What each side is:
#
#   the host   cases.m compiled against the SDK's own <PhotosUI/PhotosUI.h> and linked against the
#              host's PhotosUI framework. This is the oracle: Apple's own implementation of the
#              eleven filters, the two properties and the two methods this queue names.
#   the port   the same cases.m compiled against the transcribed header beside it, linked with the
#              port's own objects - PHPickerFilter14.m, PHPickerFilter15.m, PHPickerFilter16.m,
#              PHPickerConfiguration14.m, PHPickerConfiguration15.m and PHPickerViewController16.m -
#              built from packages/a/apple-backports/Photos with no change to any of them, and
#              without the host's PhotosUI framework in the link at all. With them the class of
#              PHPickerViewControllerStub.m, because the 14.0 object that defines
#              PHPickerViewController is UIKit's and this harness has no UIKit; the category of iOS
#              16 needs a class to attach to, and no answer the stub gives is compared.
#
# Two binaries and not one, on purpose: the port's PHPickerFilter, PHPickerConfiguration and
# PHPickerViewController have the same names as the host's, so one binary holding both would install
# the port's categories over the host's classes and the host's answers would be the port's. That is
# the defect the review of the ImageIO pixel differential found, where the port probe was the host.
#
# The comparison is over the whole set of lines: a line on one side and not the other is a
# difference, not a pass. Four questions are outside what the host's own implementation answers, and
# they are listed with their reasons in stated-differences.tsv; a listed difference that stops
# differing fails the run, because a statement about a measurement that has moved is stale.
# --mutated rewrites one answer in the port's own output before the comparison, which is what proves
# the comparison can fail: one that never differs reads as a pass and guards nothing.
#
# answers/ holds what both sides answered on the day the series was written, byte for byte, and
# --recorded holds this run to it. A committed file that says "34 the same, and 4 the host does not
# answer" is a claim about a run, and a claim about a run needs the run beside it: these two files are
# it, and this mode is what stops them going stale in the tree. Neither file is read by the
# comparison above - the two answers are always compared with each other, never with a recording.
