# run-crop.sh -- the port's crop-and-scale rules against Core ML's own image constructor, pixel for
# pixel, with a mutant that must go red.
#
# One program, built twice: once against the framework's own resampler (which is the oracle and
# answers itself, so the system binary is a self-consistency check of the program) and once against
# the port's, compiled with the rest of the library under names of its own. Both print
# `differing=N of M` per case and the run fails if any N is not zero.
#
# The harness compiles the port's function with each of CoreGraphics' interpolation qualities first
# (the header's CHARON_VISION_INTERPOLATION is the seam), which is how the one the framework uses was
# found: the numbers below are the measurement, and the default in the header is the answer.
