# The crop-rect table: where Core ML puts a picture, measured.
#
# `.agent-work/runs/crop-probe/croprect.m` writes this. A picture black except one white *column* and
# another with one white *row*, each brought to a target of a different aspect under Core ML's own
# `CenterCrop` and `ScaleFit`; the response is read across a row and down a column. The last two
# columns are the centre of the lit run, which is where the impulse landed, and the fifth is
# where the port's own rule puts it: `inset + source * scale`.
#
# The rule has to explain every row before anything in the library changes.
