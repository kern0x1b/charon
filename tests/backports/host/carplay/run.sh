# Two halves, one command, and one diff between them.
#
#   1. APPLE'S side. `headunit-probe.m` asks Apple's own CarPlay what it answers with NO head unit
#      attached, built for Mac Catalyst because that is the only place on this machine where Apple's
#      CarPlay loads: the fleet devices run 6.1.3, which has no CarPlay class of any name, and
#      /System/Library/Frameworks has no CarPlay outside the SDK.
#   2. THE PORT'S side. The port's own CarPlay sources are compiled here with their class names
#      renamed onto `charonHost_…`, so the runner reaches them through the runtime and can never reach
#      Apple's CarPlay by accident, and it drives the same questions.
#   3. THE DIFF. Both sides print `label<TAB>answer`, and every label they both carry has to answer
#      the same on both, or the run is red. That is what makes the port's rows measured rather than
#      asserted: the answer in `registry/CarPlay/ios12.json` is the answer Apple's own object gave.
#
# Each half carries a mutant, and the run FAILS if a mutant does not differ, because a comparison
# that cannot fail decides nothing. Run output lands under this repository's own .agent-work, never
# the system temp: the transcript is the evidence the registry's `source` names.
