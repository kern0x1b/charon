// CharonMPSMatrixSolveReference.h - the reference the MPSMatrix solve and decomposition kernels are
// checked against, in plain C.
//
// WHAT THE REFERENCE IS, and what it is not. It is the headers' own sentences turned into arithmetic:
//   MPSMatrixDecomposition.h:138-143  "A = L * L**T or A = U**T * U ... A is a symmetric
//                                      positive-definite matrix ... L and U are lower and upper
//                                      triangular matrices respectively"
//   MPSMatrixSolve.h:24-26            "op(A) * X = alpha * B or X * op(A) = alpha * B ... A is either
//                                      upper or lower triangular and op(A) is A**T or A"
//   MPSMatrixDecomposition.h:37-40    the four statuses, with the header's own values
// It never names the port's class, so a case that agrees is two implementations of one sentence and not
// one implementation compared with itself.
//
// THE ORACLE IS A ROUND TRIP, and that is the reason this family can be checked at all. This host's AGX
// family lacks computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType: and the release's own kernel dies encoding, so
// the release is not the oracle and no number here measures Apple's code. What CAN be checked without it
// is the identity each header states: a factorization is right when multiplying its factors back gives
// the matrix that went in, and a solve is right when multiplying its answer by A gives B. Both are
// statements about the ANSWER, not about the release's pivot order or its rounding, and both are exact
// to a float32 ulp on the values chosen in the cases.
//
// WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED: the pivot INDICES. MPSMatrixDecomposition.h:92-94 says the pivot array holds
// "an array of size 1xmin(rows, columns) values" and says nothing about which row is chosen, so the
// indices are this port's choice (partial pivoting) and the reference does not check them. The factors
// do not depend on that choice - only the order of the rows does - which is exactly why the round trip
// is the right check and an index comparison would not be.
