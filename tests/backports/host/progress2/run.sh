# NSProgress of packages/a/apple-backports/Foundation/NSProgress.m, compiled for the host with its class renamed, against the
# host's own NSProgress: counts, fractionCompleted, the current-progress stack (becomeCurrentWithPendingUnitCount:/
# resignCurrent/initWithParent:), cancelling and pausing with their handlers, userInfo and kind. Four named divergences from
# the host are tolerated - this class follows iOS 6's own measured answers there, not the host's (facts/Foundation/NSProgress.md)
# - each asserted on this class's own side unconditionally; tolerated() only annotates the host's side when it disagrees.
