# run.sh - the port's NFCNDEFPayload and NFCNDEFMessage against NDEF byte vectors, compiled from the
# port's own sources. There is no CoreNFC on the host to compare with, so the test's include path
# carries a transcription of the SDK 16.4 declarations of the two classes (tests/backports/host/corenfc/
# CoreNFC/CoreNFC.h) and the vectors are the record shape of the NFC Forum NDEF Technical Specification.
# `--mutated` flips one byte of the text vector, which must make checks fail: a test that cannot fail is
# not guarding anything.
