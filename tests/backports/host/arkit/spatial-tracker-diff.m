// The offline differential for the tracker.
//
// The host has no ARKit to compare against, so the ground truth is constructed: a camera is walked
// along a path it is also *shown*, each frame rendered by hand from where the surface point of
// each pixel really is, and the pose the tracker reports for that frame compared with the pose that
// produced it. The gyroscope's own error is added to the attitude it is driven with, because a
// gyroscope on a real device is never exact.
//
// What is measured is therefore the tracker's accuracy: the rotation it recovers against the
// rotation it was given, and the distance it walked against the distance it was told it walked.
//
// Built and run with the host's toolchain:
//   clang -o spatial-tracker-diff CharonARTracker.m spatial-tracker-diff.m \
//         -framework Foundation -framework CoreVideo -framework CoreMedia -framework CoreGraphics
