# run.sh — records what the host's Contacts answers for every case of device/contacts-cases.m in a Mac Catalyst binary, holds the port's
# Contacts classes, compiled under names of their own (Charon<name>), to the same records, and tells apart mutants of the port.
#
# Every case builds its objects in memory: no CNContactStore instance is ever asked for a permission, a fetch or a save, because the host
# runs as whoever is signed into this Mac, and this package promised never to touch that person's own address book. What is compared is
# the value-object surface - CNContact and its values, the formatter, the vCard pair (both sides delegate to the same
# ABPersonCreateVCardRepresentationWithPeople of the host's own AddressBook.framework, so this is an exact match, not an approximation),
# groups and containers before a save, and the plain value classes beside them.

# Nothing here needs to differ: every case avoids the one path (CNContactStore) that could disagree with the release for reasons that have
# nothing to do with this port - a store the host is not an oracle for at all, since it is never opened.
# One the host cannot answer: the macOS 26 host's CNContactFetchRequest archives rankSort as a bool and reads it back with
# decodeInt64ForKey:, so decoding its own archive raises NSInvalidUnarchiveOperationException (measured). What the port must answer
# there is pinned, from two host records that are compared: the host's archive carries the predicate
# (predicate.fetchRequestArchivesPredicate) and the host's predicate comes back equal from a secure archive
# (predicate.identifiersEqualAfterSecureRoundTrip), so a request read back keeps its predicate: "kept".
