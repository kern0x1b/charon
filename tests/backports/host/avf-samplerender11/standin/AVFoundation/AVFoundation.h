//  The 16.4 SDK's declarations for the two 11.0 render classes, as the port's three objects compose over
//  them, and nothing else.
//
//  What 6.1.3 carries is measured, not assumed: tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over the armv7 caches of
//  6.1.3 and 4.3 lists no AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer, no AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer and no
//  AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering protocol among that release's classes and protocols (the command, its
//  output and the control - AVCaptureDevice with 100 instance selectors at 6.1.3 - are in
//  packages/a/apple-backports/facts/AVFoundation/Release11.md), and `strings -a` over the armv7 caches
//  answers 0 for every selector below. So there is nothing here for the release to declare and everything
//  here for the port to define, which is why this header declares the SDK's own shape of the two classes
//  rather than a smaller one: the port's objects and the harness both compile against the same
//  declarations a client of the port compiles against, and the port's definitions are what answer.
//
//  What the release DOES have, and what this header therefore does not declare as the port's to bring:
//
//    - CoreMedia's timebase: _CMTimebaseCreateWithMasterClock, _CMClockGetHostTimeClock,
//      _CMTimebaseSetTime, _CMTimebaseGetTime, _CMTimebaseSetRate, _CMTimebaseGetRate,
//      _CMTimebaseSetRateAndAnchorTime, _CMTimebaseSetMasterTimebase, _CMTimebaseSetMasterClock,
//      _CMTimebaseAddTimerDispatchSource, _CMTimebaseSetTimerDispatchSourceNextFireTime and
//      _CMTimebaseRemoveTimerDispatchSource, all read from 6.1.3's own CoreMedia export trie.
//    - AudioToolbox's queue: the 43 exports matching "AudioQueue" of 6.1.3's AudioToolbox, of which this
//      port's renderer uses ten.
//    - _AVFoundationErrorDomain, first held rung 4.0, which standin.m defines as the release defines it.
//
//  Two rules this header keeps, and both are the point of linking the port's real objects against it
//  instead of compiling a copy of them: it declares no member as implemented (the classes and the protocol
//  are declared and not implemented here, because nothing below 11.0 has them), and it declares every
//  member the 16.4 header does, so the port's objects cannot quietly implement a member that is not one of
//  the SDK's.
