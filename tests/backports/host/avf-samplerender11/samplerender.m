// AVFoundation - the ORACLE, from which every expectation in the join is read - and once with -I standin
// and the port's own AVFoundation/AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer11.m,
// AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer11.m, AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer12.m and
// AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer14.m linked in UNMODIFIED, against a stand-in release shaped like the
// one the port runs on: 6.1.3 carries no AVSampleBufferAudioRenderer, no
// AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer and no AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering protocol at all, which
// tools/corpus/objc-inventory.lua over the armv7 caches of 6.1.3 and 4.3 answers (the command, its
// output and the control - AVCaptureDevice with 100 instance selectors at 6.1.3 - are in
// packages/a/apple-backports/facts/AVFoundation/Release11.md).
//
// Every row is a question the header asks, asked through the SHARED selectors, on the same generated
// sample buffers: a 1 kHz sine at 44.1 kHz, 100 ms per buffer, each with a known output presentation
// timestamp. Nothing here asks a question only one build can answer: the two classes are constructed the
// same way on both sides, -init, because that is the construction both the 16.4 SDK and this Mac's SDK
// declare (the -initWithAudioFormatDescription:bufferCapacity: of 11.0 is in neither, and
// +sampleBufferAudioRenderer is a runtime factory no header here declares, so neither half may use it).
//
// The join is not "nothing differs". A row that both halves print must agree unless ALLOWANCES names it,
// a row the host prints and the port does not is always a failure, and a row only one side prints is
// always a failure. ALLOWANCES is a short list of differences that are in the PORT's build, each with the
// measurement that explains it.
//
// Timing rows are asked as booleans and buckets, never as raw instants: a row whose answer is a
// millisecond on one machine and a different millisecond on another is not a row, and the two tolerance
// rows below name the bound that was measured.
