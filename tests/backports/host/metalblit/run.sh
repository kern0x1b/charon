# run.sh — differential host test for Metal's blits and mip chain.
#
# What runs here, and what does not, is deliberate and is written down rather than discovered:
#
#   * The port's **buffer** blits run. CharonMetalBuffer.m and the copy and fill methods of
#     CharonMetalBlitEncoder hold no OpenGL ES 2.0, so they compile for Mac Catalyst with the port's
#     classes renamed and run in one process beside macOS Metal's own blit encoder, on the same
#     inputs, and the bytes that come out are compared.
#   * The port's **texture** blits do not run here. CharonMetalTexture is an ES 2.0 texture, and
#     Catalyst has no EAGL context to make one in. What this test does for those is record macOS
#     Metal's own answers into metalblit-expectations.h, which tests/backports/device/metalblit.m
#     holds the port to on the device; the recording is the oracle, and the device test is where the
#     port's answer meets it.
#   * The **mip geometry** is the same: macOS Metal's level extents and bytes-per-row are recorded,
#     and the port's own level arithmetic is checked against the recorded ones here, since
#     levelExtent() is pure.
