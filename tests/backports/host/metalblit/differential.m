// What runs here is the port's own code, compiled from packages/a/apple-backports/Metal with its
// classes renamed, so the two cannot be confused for one another. What it covers is the part of a
// blit that is the port's own arithmetic rather than a call into OpenGL ES 2.0: the buffer-to-buffer
// copy, the byte-value fill, and the refusals. The texture side of a blit and the mip chain are ES 2.0
// objects, which a host has no way to make — the answers macOS Metal gives for those are recorded by
// oracle.m into metalblit-expectations.h and held to on the device by tests/backports/device/metalblit.m.
//
// Every expectation below is Apple's, measured by oracle.m and written into that header. Nothing here
// is checked against the port's own idea of what the answer should be.
