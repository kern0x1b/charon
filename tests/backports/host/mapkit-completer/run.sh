# The completer's delegate, compared against the HOST's own MKLocalSearchCompleter: the calls, their
# order and their values, for the same query and the same delegate.
#
# The port's completer is built here as a macOS dylib with its class renamed, because the class name is
# Apple's and only a rename lets both answer the same query in one probe. Apple's own is reached
# through the unrenamed name.
#
# THE MUTANT is a second build of the same source with -DCHARON_DELEGATE_MUTANT, where the port's
# completer hands the delegate the wrong argument. Everything else is identical, so a mutant that does
# not go red means the comparison cannot see a wrong argument -- and the probe says so and fails,
# because a green mutant is a comparison that decides nothing.
