# The negative control of emulate.sh: the same suite against a copy of the port whose lookup of the runtime's weak
# references answers "none", so every weak side is watched only, as on 4.3. It must fail: exit 0 means it did, exit 1 that
# the suite passed a port whose native path was taken out and so does not tell the two paths apart. It runs on 5.1.1
# (MAPTABLE6_RELEASES, with 6.0 for the answers to compare), where the calls that read every entry's key are tried:
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/host/maptable6/control.sh
# MAPTABLE6_ROUNDS and MAPTABLE6_BUILD are emulate.sh's; the logs are left in $MAPTABLE6_BUILD/run.
