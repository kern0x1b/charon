# tests/backports/host/maptable6 as a device binary under xmake emulate: the port against the release's own factories on
# 6.0, and the port alone on 4.3, 5.0 and 5.1.1, whose answers to the weak scenarios must be 6.0's; then, on each, a class
# that refuses a weak reference as the weak side of each table, whose outcome on 5.0 and later must be 6.0's. One heavy job
# (a build and an emulated boot a release, and one a case of the refusal), so run it in a slot of the machine:
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/host/maptable6/emulate.sh
# MAPTABLE6_ROUNDS=n sets the rounds of the two-thread check (default 20000). It needs the addon v0.8.10 in the shared xmake store, as any port does, and the firmware of the releases named below.
# MAPTABLE6_PORT names the port's source, for control.sh, which builds a port with its native path taken out.
# Leaves the logs in $MAPTABLE6_BUILD/<release>.log and exits 1 on a failed check or an answer that is not 6.0's.
