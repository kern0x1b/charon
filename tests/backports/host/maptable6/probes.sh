# The two probes the facts cite, as device binaries under xmake emulate (one heavy job):
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/host/maptable6/probes.sh
# enumprobe (probes/enum.m): the owner enumerating keys while others drop keys and values, on 5.1.1 (clean) and 4.3 (SIGSEGV).
# weakprobe (probes/weak.m): what libobjc's handle and dlsym answer for the weak functions, then __weak to the classes that keep their own retain count, on 5.0, 5.1.1, 6.0 and 4.3 (aborts there).
# weakwindowprobe (probes/weakwindow.m): what a __weak reference reads as -dealloc runs, for a class that does not keep its own retain count, on 5.0, 5.1.1, 6.0 and 4.3 - the one measurement the 4.3 paragraph of the facts calls unmeasured.
# The verdicts are read, not asserted: a crash on 4.3 is what the facts say. Logs in $MAPTABLE6_BUILD.
# MAPTABLE6_BOOT is the whole-boot timeout in seconds (xmake emulate's -t, 900 by default). A release with no golden image
# yet in ~/.charon/emulator has to boot once past its first-boot migration before it can run anything, and on a machine
# busy with two gate bands that first boot is the one that gives out - measured on 2026-10-03: the build and all three
# installs finished ("imports: every non-weak import ... resolves against 85386 exports", "install ok!") and
# "booting iPhone2,1 9A334 once past its first-boot migration for a golden image" answered "error: <no error object>".
