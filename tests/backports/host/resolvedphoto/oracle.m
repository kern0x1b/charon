// selector per line in the file given as argument 1) is answered by the port with the host's type encoding, and the

// wrote. Values are not compared here: the host's class is made only by a capture, and a capture on the host needs a
// camera and its permission; tests/backports/device/photooutput10.m holds the values to real captures.
