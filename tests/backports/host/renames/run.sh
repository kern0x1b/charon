#!/bin/sh
# run.sh — what tests/backports/host/uikit2/renames.sh is allowed to do. The differential compiles the backport's
# sources into the same process as the framework they sit beside, so the port's names have to move: renames()
# gives a CharonHost prefix to the classes and C symbols the objects define, and prefix_selectors.py gives one to
# the selectors the port's Charon categories carry, whole.
#
# A -D can only rename a whole identifier, so only a class name and a C symbol may be renamed that way. A selector
# is not one: setObject:forTrait: is three of them, and a -D for the `object` in it renames every other use of that
# word in the file, the SDK's included. This test pins both halves of the rule - renames() renames no piece of a
# selector, and it still renames the class and the C symbol - and then checks what broke: the flags leave a file
# that includes Foundation and writes a dictionary element compiling. With -Dobject= the SDK's os/object.h declares
# @interface OS_object under the new name while os/workgroup_base.h, whose use of it sits behind a `, ## __VA_ARGS__`
# and is not expanded, still asks for OS_object, so os/workgroup_object.h:49 fails and every source that includes
# dispatch stops compiling.
