# run.sh -- what the blur's shading costs, and so how much of a UIVisualEffectView refresh has to be
# on the main thread at all.
#
# Compiles the port's own CharonBlur.m against a C shim for its Objective-C header
# (blurcost/CharonBlur.h) and times charon_blur_pixels at the three sizes
# packages/a/apple-backports/facts/UIKit/UIVisualEffect.md reports a whole refresh at. That is the
# BEFORE figure for moving the shading off the main thread: the read stays there whatever happens, and
# this is not it.
#
# The shim is a copy, not a -I path: CharonBlur.m includes its header with quotes, and a quoted include
# looks in the including file's own directory before any -I, so the package's Objective-C header wins
# from wherever the compiler is run. The source is therefore copied beside the shim -- and `cmp` says
# the copy is the package's file, so a measurement cannot be taken against a source that has drifted
# from the one the port ships.
