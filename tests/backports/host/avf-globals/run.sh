#!/bin/sh
# run.sh -- the AVFoundation constants the port carries, the port against the host, in one binary.
#
# One program. probe.m is compiled plain, so every BARE name in it is Apple's own symbol; the port's
# five AVFoundationGlobals*.m are compiled with every constant name defined to its `charon_host_`
# spelling and linked beside it, so the PREFIXED name is the port's own definition of the same
# constant. One process then reads both and prints them side by side, and the join below is a
# comparison of the two columns of one run rather than of two runs that could have drifted.
#
# A value the port invented cannot agree with the host's, which is the whole point: these are 116
# constants whose value is a fact about Apple's own image, and "a constant with an invented value" is a
# silent fake the tree forbids.
#
# Run DIRECTLY, not through heavy.sh: this is five small compiles and one run, and heavy.sh's job is the
# package builds.
#
# What makes it a check rather than a comparison:
#
#   * the names are READ from the port's own sources, never typed here, so the check cannot drift away
#     from what the port defines, and a name a source defines that the check does not ask about is
#     reported;
#   * the row count is DERIVED from the run ("names read: N rows: M") and compared against what the
#     sources hold, so an empty table is a red and not a clean diff of two empty files;
#   * the probe prints four controls and this script requires each to be what it must be, so a run that
#     loaded nothing cannot pass;
#   * the harness is PLANTED and the plant must go red: one value in one source is changed, and the run
#     must notice it. A check that cannot fail proves nothing. CONTROL=1 puts the unmutated sources
#     through the identical path and must stay clean, so a red is the mutation and not the path;
#   * a mutation that does not build is RUN FAILED with the compiler's own lines, so a build failure is
#     never counted as a noticed mutation.

# THE DECLARED GETTER, not the property name. `@property (readonly, getter=wasReadFromCache) BOOL
# readFromCache;` declares a property called readFromCache whose accessor is -wasReadFromCache, so a probe
# that asks for -readFromCache finds nothing on EITHER side and reports the row equal - it never asks.
# CharonAVMetrics18.h:156 is that line, and the first version of this list asked the property name, so
# `-[AVMetricMediaResourceRequestEvent readFromCache] host=no` was a statement about a selector neither side
# implements rather than about the port carrying more than the host.
#
# So the list carries the SELECTOR the header declares, read out of the header itself, and a row whose
# accessor cannot be found there is reported rather than guessed at.

# and reads and writes ITS ivars at ITS offsets on a port object.
#
# The dump that showed it, from the port's own class:

# copy is renamed at its @implementation line and lands on a stand-in owner this build declares
# (charon_host_AVCaptureSession), while the port's class is renamed the way the metric phase renames its
# seventeen. The category NAME is not renamed and the stand-in declares that same name, so a category
# spelled differently in the port's source still fails to compile (clang: "cannot find interface
# declaration for '<name>'"), and the reason strings the port raises stay Apple's own text.
