"""The AST contract check for the HomeKit rows.

The port's own headers import <HomeKit/HomeKit.h> from the iOS SDK, and the SDK's HomeKit types are
marked API_UNAVAILABLE(macos) - so nothing of the model compiles for this host, and there is no
HomeKit framework in any macOS SDK to ask. A probe that runs is therefore not available, and this check is
what runs instead: it compiles the port's source for **iOS** and compares the **port's** declarations
against the **header's**, from clang's AST, without executing anything.

For every class this piece carries, and for every property the header declares on it:

  * the port declares a member of that name;
  * with the same type, nullability included - the AST's qualType carries the _Nonnull/_Nullable the
    header wrote, and a port that declared the property nullable where the header does not would be
    answered differently by a caller;
  * with the same attributes: readonly, copy, nonatomic, weak;
  * and a property the header marks NS_UNAVAILABLE is absent from the port.

The attributes compared are the ones the header writes. `strong` is the default and is not written on a
property line, so it is not compared - what would be compared is a *changed* attribute, and a property
that lost `readonly` or `copy` is caught by the absence of the key rather than by its presence here.

The control: run against a scratch copy with one property's attribute flipped, and this must name it and
exit non-zero. A check that cannot fail is not a check.

# The setup family: METHODS, and one object per release.
#
# Everything above is property-shaped, and a class with no properties measures nothing -- which is
# exactly HMAccessorySetupPayload, the release declaring no property on it at all. So the same file now
# carries methods, and the comparison is per OBJECT rather than per class, because the band machinery
# refuses an object with the API of two releases: the 11.3 initialiser and the 13.0 one are two objects,
# and each must bind exactly its own release's members and nothing of the other's.
#
# The selector comes from the AST's mangledName rather than from `name`, and that is mechanical: for a
# selector with arguments, `name` is only the first piece ("initWithURL"), so a check built on it would
# compare the wrong string for every multi-argument method. The release and the NS_UNAVAILABLE mark come
# from the HEADER'S OWN LINE, read out of the SDK the check is already pointed at -- this clang's JSON
# dump carries availability as an api_avail number in the mangled name, and a check that decoded that
# would be reading an encoding rather than the release's declaration.

# "class" is the release the class itself arrived with, and it is STATED rather than inferred: a member
# whose header line carries no API_AVAILABLE of its own is a member of the class's release, and deriving
# that from the table (the first version took min() over the members' releases) made the expectation
# depend on whatever the table happened to hold, which a scratch copy can change.
