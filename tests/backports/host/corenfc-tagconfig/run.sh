# run.sh - the port's NFCTagCommandConfiguration and its two ISO15693 subclasses, against the host's
# CoreNFC through Mac Catalyst. The port's classes are built from packages/a/apple-backports/CoreNFC
# with their names prefixed, so the port's and the host's coexist in one process and every value is
# compared against what the host's own object answers (facts/CoreNFC/TagConfiguration.md).
#
# `--fail-first` is the mutation that proves the run bites: it makes the port's copyWithZone: drop the
# base's retry fields and its three-field initialiser drop the base's zero retries, so every check
# that reads a copy must then fail. The mutation is made on a COPY of the source under $build, so no
# test hook is compiled into the port's own file - the tree's other mutation (corenfc/run.sh
# --mutated) likewise leaves the port's source alone.
