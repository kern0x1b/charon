// release's own MPSImageThresholdToZero resolves, by dladdr on its encode method, to
//
//   /System/Library/Frameworks/MetalPerformanceShaders.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/MPSImage.framework/…
//
// and then the process dies with
//
//   '-[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer mtlnext computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:]': unrecognized selector
//
// because this host's AGX family does not implement the encoder selector the framework calls. It answers
// nothing here, so the reference is the header's formula, computed in this file, and every registry row for
// this family says so in its reason.
//
// THE FORMULAS, as the headers state them, cited by file and line so a reader can check them:
//
//   MPSImageThreshold.h:194  MPSImageThresholdToZero         dst = src > threshold ? src : 0
//   MPSImageThreshold.h:246  MPSImageThresholdToZeroInverse  dst = src > threshold ? 0 : src

//
// The comparison is a whole float32 ulp of the expected answer, because these kernels accumulate in double
// and store float32: the difference between "the port is right" and "the port is one rounding off" is
// exactly that, and a tolerance wider than it would hide a real defect while a narrower one would fail

// MPSImageReduce, from MPSImageReduce.h of the iPhoneOS 26.2 surface: four reductions over a row or a
// column - min, max, mean, sum. Nine rows owe this family: MPSImageReduceUnary abstract, and RowMin,
// ColumnMin, RowMax, ColumnMax, RowMean, ColumnMean, RowSum, ColumnSum.
//
// What the header says, at :53, :74, :91, :108, :125, :142, :159 and :176: the Row classes return "the
// mininmum value for each row of an image" (the release's own spelling), "the maximum value for each
// row", "the mean value for each row", "the sum for each row"; the Column classes say the same for each
// column. So a row reduction over a rows x cols image answers `rows` values and a column reduction
// answers `cols`. That much is the header's wording and it is what fixes the count.
//
// The read window is MPSImageReduce.h:31-42's clipRectSource: "The source rectangle to use when reading
// data ... If the clipRectSource does not lie completely within the source image, the intersection of
// the image bounds and clipRectSource will be used. The clipRectSource replaces the MPSUnaryImageKernel
// offset parameter for this filter. The latter is ignored. Default: MPSRectNoClip, use the entire source
// texture." So `offset` does not enter this reduction at all - unlike every other unary kernel in this
// package - and clipRectSource is INTERSECTED with the image rather than applied on its own. That is
// why the indices below are clamped to the image and not used raw: the reference models the
// intersection rather than assuming a caller passes a rectangle that fits.
//
// `clipRect` is a different thing and is NOT the read window. MPSImageReduce.h:38-40: "The clipRect
// specified in MPSUnaryImageKernel is used to control the origin in the destination texture where the
// min, max values are written. The clipRect.width must be >=2. The clipRect.height must be >= 1." That is
// where the write lands, and the two bounds are a precondition the kernel refuses, not a result.
//
// What the header does NOT say is the destination's shape. Each class fixes how many values there are
// and not their width or height. It cannot be measured here - this host's AGX family lacks
// computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType: and the release's own kernel dies encoding - so the case builds
// the one-by-rows and cols-by-one destinations the class names imply and says so, rather than claiming
// it measured the release. Every row of this family carries that AGX reason.
//
// min, max and sum are compared for EQUALITY: they select or add values the source already holds, so a
// copy that moved a bit is a copy that moved a bit. mean divides, and dividing cannot be exact in
// binary, so it is compared with the same bound the rest of this file uses - one whole float32 ulp,
// CharonOneUlp - and that bound is stated rather than left implicit. A mean sums in double and divides
// once, so one float32 ulp is the whole of its error and not a slackened check.

//
// :17-18 MPSImageAreaMax "finds the maximum pixel value in a rectangular region centered around each pixel
// in the source image. If there are multiple channels in the source image, each channel is processed in"
// its own window, so the channel is a third loop and not a divide of the buffer. MPSImageAreaMin is the
// minimum over the same window; MPSImageDilate is the maximum with the caller's probe (:129 "values The
// set of values to use as the dilate probe", :116 "Each dilate shape probe defines a 3D surface of
// values", so one height per tap, row-major); MPSImageErode is the minimum over the same probe.
//
// THE EDGE IS CLAMPED, and this is what makes the family unlike the convolution's. :69 and :93 both say
// "The edgeMode property is assumed to always be MPSImageEdgeModeClamp for this filter." So a tap reaching
// off the edge takes the nearest edge VALUE, not zero. The convolution reference multiplies an off-edge
// sample by zero; this one clamps the index instead, and the case runs a window wider than the image
// precisely so the two cannot both pass.
//
// COMPARED FOR EQUALITY, and that is the header's semantics rather than a convenience. A maximum and a
// minimum SELECT a value the source already holds: nothing is added, nothing is multiplied, so the answer
// is bit-for-bit one of the inputs and a tolerance could only hide a real defect. The convolution family's
// reference carries one float32 ulp because that family accumulates and stores; this one carries none,
// and the difference is stated here rather than left for a reader to infer from a missing tolerance.

//   histogramForAlpha, minPixelValue ("Any pixel value less t[han]" it) and maxPixelValue ("Any pixel
//   value greate[r than]" it) - so the range is half-open at the bottom, closed at the top, and a value

//   the G bins, then the B bins, then the A bins - so CHANNEL-MAJOR, and :208 "If

//   RGB channels are stored".
//
// EXACT, and for the same reason the morphology reference is exact: a histogram COUNTS. It selects a bin
// and adds one, so the answer is an integer and a tolerance could only hide an off-by-one. There is no ulp
// here, and that is stated because the convolution family's reference has one and the difference is a
// decision about what the operation does rather than an inconsistency in how it is checked.
