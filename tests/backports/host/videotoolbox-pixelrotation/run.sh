# run.sh - VideoToolbox's pixel rotation, held to what this Mac's own VTPixelRotationSession does AND to an
# expectation computed from the source pattern alone.
#
#   1. probe.m asks the host for 320 cells - ten source shapes x two pixel formats x sixteen operations, four
#      rotations crossed with the two flips alone and together - and compares each against pixels derived
#      from the source alone. All four channels of every pixel are compared, and so are the bytes between
#      the end of each row and the start of the next.
#   2. probe.m checks its own expectation against a HAND-WRITTEN 180 PER SHAPE before the host is asked for
#      that shape, so a wrong expectation cannot hide behind a matching host. The 2x4 shape whose display
#      channel runs 1 11 / 21 31 / 41 51 / 61 71 must come back upside down, 71 61 / 51 41 / 31 21 / 11 1;
#      the 3x5 and the 1-wide shapes have theirs written out the same way, ten of them.
#   3. A forced padded bytesPerRow is ASSERTED, not hoped for: there is no public CVPixelBufferAttributeKey
#      for a bytes per row, so the padded stride comes from an IOSurface wrapped by
#      CVPixelBufferCreateWithIOSurface, and a stride the caller did not get is counted and fails the run.
#   4. Four plants must each turn it red, and each red must be shown PER SHAPE, because a shape whose cells
#      are never compared is green for the wrong reason. The fourth is a wrong HAND-WRITTEN 180: no cell
#      differs when it is wrong, so the hand-check is the only thing that can catch it, and the run proves
#      that it does.
#   5. The refusals are measured and asserted where the port will cite them: the rotation property is a
#      CFStringRef (three ways of getting that wrong, all kVTParameterErr = -12902), OneComponent8 and
#      444YpCbCr8 answer kVTPixelRotationNotSupportedErr = -12914, a 420 destination is converted rather
#      than rotated, a cross-format destination is converted rather than rotated, and a destination geometry
#      VTPixelRotationSession.h:79 forbids is scale-to-fitted rather than refused.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM: any biplanar YUV. A 420 image's chroma planes are subsampled by two
# on each axis, so rotating one is a second contract with its own arithmetic, and the host answers a 420
# destination with a colour conversion, not with a rotation.

# turn red at. The run reads the shape's own pixel count out of the mutant's SIZE line rather than out of a
# list of shapes written here, and the floor is 2 for all three because a ONE-PIXEL shape is the fixed
# point of all three faults: a quarter turn of one pixel is the identity (dest(x,y) = src(y, H-1-x) with
# H = 1 and y = x = 0), a rejected rotation property leaves the session at kVTRotation_0, which on one
# pixel is the same picture, and base + i*4 with one destination pixel is base + 0, the same address. That
# the 1x1 shape is green under every plant is therefore arithmetic, and the table below prints it as green
