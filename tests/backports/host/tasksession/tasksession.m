/* tasksession.m - what the host's own NSURLSession does with a task's delegate.

   The three rules, from SDK 16.4 NSURLSession.h:296-304, where the property is declared:

       Sets a task-specific delegate. Methods not implemented on this delegate will
       still be forwarded to the session delegate.
       Cannot be modified after task resumes. Not supported on background session.
       Delegate is strongly referenced until the task completes, after which it is
       reset to `nil`.

   Each is asked of the system's own Foundation, not of the port: the port's objects are armv7
   iOS 6.1.3 and this program is macOS. Nothing here reads the port.

   Four runs, in this order, and each is worthless if the control before it did not pass:

     1. control   - the reader can see the property, the protocol and a live task, and a task with
                    no delegate of its own reports nil. A reader that could not see them would
                    report every rule as "does not happen".
     2. forwarding- the task's delegate implements NOTHING, the session's implements
                    URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError:. Who hears the completion?
     3. partial   - the task's delegate implements exactly that one selector. Who hears it now?
     4. lifetime  - is -setDelegate: after -resume accepted or refused, and with what; and does
                    -delegate read nil once the task has completed.

   Nothing leaves the machine: every task is http://127.0.0.1:1/, which is refused by the loopback
   stack immediately, so the completion fires locally and no name is resolved. */
