# The expectations file is TRACKED, and the device-side usernotifications.m compiles against it, so
# the redirect used to write into it directly: the shell truncates the target before the binary has
# produced a byte, and anything that ends this line early - the sweep's own 120 s kill, a signal, a
# failed build above - leaves the tree with a truncated expectations file. Measured: after a full
# host sweep the file was 610 rows short of HEAD, and a completed run regenerates the same 5760 rows,
# so nothing about the content was in question and everything about the exposure was.
#
# So it is written beside the tree and moved into place only once the run that produced it has ended
# with status 0. A failure leaves the tracked file exactly as it was, which is the only outcome that
# can be right: a half-written expectations header is a tree that no longer says what it said.
