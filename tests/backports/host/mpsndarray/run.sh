#!/bin/sh
# run.sh - does this port's MPSNDArray hold the same shapes, the same views and the same bytes as the
# release's own MPSNDArray?
#
# WHAT THIS SETTLES, and what it does not. The descriptor's own arithmetic, the order a view is built
# in, the element order a packed read and write walk, and the width of a row are THIS OBJECT's work
# and nothing else in the package reaches them. So every shared case here is a question about storage,
# and storage is the one part of MPS the release's own framework answers on this host - which is why
# there are TWO builds and a comparison rather than a build against a CPU reference.
# tests/backports/host/mpsimage9/run.sh records the other half of this: that this host's AGX family
# lacks computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType: and the release's own MPSImage kernels die encoding, so
# for the KERNELS a reference is the header's formula and nothing here claims a kernel.
#
# WHAT THE RELEASE CANNOT ANSWER HERE, measured and not assumed. Two cases are port-only and live in
# export-cases.m: the export/import pair, and a ShallNotAlias copy. The release's own
# -exportDataWithCommandBuffer:toBuffer:... and its ShallNotAlias path both die with
# '-[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer_mtlnext retainedReferences]: unrecognized selector', raised inside
# MPSCore's MPSNewBufferForTexture on its way to MPSDecrementReadCount - the same AGX-family
# limitation the image family records, reached here through a STORAGE path rather than a compute one.
# Those two state their own expectations in their own file, and the rows that rest on them say so.
#
# THE RENAME, and it is the mechanism mpsimage9's and mpscnn's harnesses already use rather than a
# copy of it: a header built from the classes the port's objects DEFINE, applied to BOTH the objects
# and the case file. The host's MPS framework defines every class this object defines, so unrenamed
# the process holds two classes of each name and whichever loaded first answers the case - a
# difference the comparison could never see, because it would be comparing the release with itself.
# The rename is the mechanism; the plants below are the receipt.
#
# A PLANT in the port's own COPY path, and it is this object's own rather than the family-wide
# CharonMPSStore one - which measurably does not reach here, because -readBytes:strideBytes: and
# -writeBytes:strideBytes: copy bytes and never call the store, so a plant on that path produces a
# byte-identical binary and a green run it did not earn. Two plants, first and last byte, so a
# comparison that reads only one end of each case cannot see one of them. The run has to pass once and
# fail twice, or the comparison is not looking at the thing it claims to.
