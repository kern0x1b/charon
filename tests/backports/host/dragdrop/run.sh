# CharonDropSession, which UIDragInteraction.m sends to; CharonDragDrop.m holds
# charon_set_drag_interaction_enabled_default, which +[UIDragInteraction initialize] calls. A class and a C
# helper are both reached without a symbol the linker can name, so only these sources say whether they
# are there, and the link is the check that the list is complete.

# UIDragDropSession (UIDragDropSession.m:20, and registry/UIKit/ios11.json carries the row), so the flag

# CharonHostDragDropSession, which no rename ever produced. It read "drop session is constructible" as a
# FAIL because NSClassFromString answered nil. The right-hand side is what the differential asks for and
