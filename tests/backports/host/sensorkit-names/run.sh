#!/bin/sh
# run.sh - the port's SensorKit names against the host's own SensorKit, in two processes, with the
# mutation layer that makes the comparison falsifiable.
#
#   1. the port's own sources are COMPILED and LINKED into the differential, which prints what the port
#      holds - two of them, because an object carries the API of one release and the family now spans
#      seven: SensorKitNames14.m for the 39 names of iOS 14.0, and names-extra.m, which imports
#      CharonSensorKitNames.h with all six later guards, for the 18 of 15.0 .. 26.0
#   2. the reader is COMPILED and LINKED separately, and opens the host's framework to print what it holds
#   3. compare.py puts the two side by side, name by name, over the one list both walk
#   4. three plants: every value wrong in both port sources, one value wrong in the first, and one in
#      the second - each must turn the comparison red, and each one-wrong plant must name exactly one
#      row. Two of them rather than one, because there are two port-side sources now and a mutation
#      that only reaches the first would leave the second one unwatched
#   5. the comparator's own control: a HOST file with no rows must be red, so a run that compared
#      nothing cannot look green
