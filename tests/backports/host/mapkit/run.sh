#   the projection        MKMapPointForCoordinate / MKCoordinateForMapPoint, the port through

#   the distance format   MKDistanceFormatter, over both measures and both styles
#   the camera            +cameraLookingAtCenterCoordinate:fromEyeCoordinate:eyeAltitude: and

#   the tile URL          MKTileOverlay -URLForTilePath: and the header's own {x}{y}{z}{scale}
#   the geodesic         MKGeodesicPolyline's point count and its end points against the great circle
#
# The port's objects are compiled with their own names renamed to charonHost_*, so the two live in
# one process: the host's own MapKit answers for the unrenamed name beside it.
