# run.sh — the host probe for the os_signpost family the port carries over its own os_log
# (packages/a/apple-backports/Foundation/CharonOSSignpost11.m and CharonOSSignpost12.m).
#
# It asks the host's own os_signpost the three questions the port's records make claims about: whether
# signposts are enabled, what the two id sources answer, and whether either of them is a reserved value.
# compare.py then requires the answers the port's code comments, facts/Foundation/OSLogSignpost.md and
# registry/Foundation/oslog.json state about the host to be the answers the host actually gives, so a
# record that drifts goes red. This is the check that would have found the high-bit convention the M-Z
# review measured: the host answers 0x1 for the first generated id, with the bit clear, and the port's
# records now say exactly that.
#
# The port's own build is NOT compiled here, and the reason is measured rather than guessed: the store
# reads an interval's subsystem and category out of CharonOSLog's ivars, so its object file needs that
# class, and CharonOSLog declares <OS_os_log> - which on a host is Apple's real protocol, so the runtime
# mixes the port's class with the host's os_log objects. Without the class the link fails with
# "_OBJC_IVAR_$_CharonOSLog._subsystem ... ld: symbol(s) not found"; with the class compiled in, lldb
# shows a recursion in charon_os_log_self (objc_storeStrong -> charon_os_log_self -> objc_storeStrong).
# Compiling it anyway is what found the unchecked cast now fixed in CharonOSSignpost11.m - that fix is in
# the series. What cannot be done from a host is a differential of this family; this file says so rather
# than claiming one.
