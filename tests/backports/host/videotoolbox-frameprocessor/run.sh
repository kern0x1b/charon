#!/bin/sh
# run.sh - the VideoToolbox frame processor, held to what the host's own VideoToolbox answers and to
# what the port's compiled armv7 objects carry.
#
#   1. host-answers.m asks the HOST: the error domain's string, the fourteen error codes, what
#      +new and -init do on the sixteen classes SDK 26.2 marks NS_UNAVAILABLE (through objc_msgSend,
#      because a bracketed call will not compile against the annotation), and what +isSupported says.
#   2. check_port.py holds the PORT to all of it, and to the registry: the domain string in the
#      compiled object rather than in the source, the fourteen code values in the port's own header,
#      the seven VTFrameProcessor methods in VTFrameProcessor.o, the two methods the other two classes
#      gained, and the NS_UNAVAILABLE classes carrying neither -init nor +new.
#   3. three plants, each of which must turn step 2 red: an error code mistyped in the header, the
#      error domain's string written from the constant's name instead of measured, and an NS_UNAVAILABLE
#      class given an -init.
#   4. the check's own control: an object carrying none of the seven must not look green.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT: that +isSupported answers what the host answers. This host is an
# M4 Pro with the Neural Engine these processors need and answers 1; the port answers NO because no
# armv7 release has one. That is the documented behaviour for hardware a device lacks, and a check that
# demanded the two agree would be demanding a lie.
