# build.sh -- the renderer's five properties and its arithmetic, asked of the system's own
# UITextDragPreviewRenderer and of the port's in one process, under Mac Catalyst.
#
# The two classes are reached differently, and that is the whole trick:
#
#   * the port's file is compiled ALONE, with -D renaming the class it implements, so it is linked
#     as a second class rather than colliding with the system's;
#   * this comparison is compiled WITHOUT the -D, so its own translation unit still names the
#     system's class, and the port's is reached by name at run time with NSClassFromString.
#
# So the -D reaches the port's translation unit alone. That is the usual reason a renamed class
# comes out "not found": the rename reached the comparison too, or the renamed object was never
# linked.
