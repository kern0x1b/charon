-- The generated protocol sources for this library's implemented protocol rows, written by
-- modules/apple/backports.lua's own protocol_sources() - the same function the build calls, with the
-- same argument order - and their paths printed, one per line, for the caller to compile.
--
-- The NAMES come from the registry too, in protocol-check.sh, with python3. They do not come from here:
-- a lua json read in this environment returned zero rows and said nothing about it, which is the shape of
-- check that examines nothing, and a check that examines nothing is what this file's companion check was
-- caught being last time.
