// accessibilitymap - AXBrailleMap against the host's own.
//
// One source, two programs. The host half links the system's Accessibility.framework; the port half is
// built with the class name remapped to a name the system does not use and links no Accessibility
// framework, so its class is the port's own. Each prints "label<TAB>value" per case in the same order
// and run.sh compares the two outputs line by line.
//
// The map comes from NSClassFromString and alloc on both sides, and that is not a dodge: the header
// marks -init and +new unavailable, so a program that compiled `[[AXBrailleMap alloc] init]` would not
// build, and the system has no public way to make one at all. The host half's map is the one its own
// braille service would have made, which is exactly the object the port's zero-sized fresh map has to
// answer like - measured, and the two answers are the same for every case here.
//
// What is NOT in this file: anything about the size a map is made with. The system has no way to make
// a sized map, so the only question about a size - that the port's own factory gives the map the size it
// is handed - is asked in factory-probe.m, which builds the port half alone. And nothing about what
// presentImage: shows, because a program cannot read a display.
