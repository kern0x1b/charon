# accessibilitymap/mutants.sh - every mutant of AXBrailleMap has to be told apart by the case of
# run.sh, and by the failure report run.sh prints.
#
# A differential that examines nothing says it passed, and a mutant that stops the build says nothing
# either, so a mutant here has to be held by the comparison - a line of the two answers that do not
# match and the whole diff the run prints when they do not, both required - and the suite fails if no
# mutant dies that way.
#
# The rules each mutant breaks:
#   M1  a pin is not stored, so nothing reads back
#   M2  a height is clamped to the unit range, where the host clamps nothing
#   M3  a negative point is refused, where the host takes one
#   M4  the copy shares the original's store, where the host's copy is its own map
#   M5  the copy drops the pins, where the host's copy carries them
#   M6  the archive drops the pins, where the host's own round trip carries them
#   M7  the size is not carried through the copy
#   M8  the factory answers the size it was asked for
#   M9  a copy's store is mutable again, where the system's is frozen and a write to a copy raises
#  M10  a registry protocol row names a protocol that does not exist, so the name does not resolve
#  M11  the control for M10: the registry copied through the same path with nothing changed, which must
#       stay green - without it, a check that was red for any reason at all would pass M10
#  M12  a sized map's archive drops its pins, which nothing checked before 2026-09-29
#  M13  a sized map's archive drops its size
#  M14  an unarchived map's store is frozen, which is what the port's was and the host's is not
#
# Each mutation runs against a copy of the tree's own file with one line changed, so the unmutated
# counterpart of every one of them is the tree, which the run before them holds green; M11 is the
# explicit control for the path itself.
