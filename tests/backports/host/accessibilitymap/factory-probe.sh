# factory-probe.sh - build and run the port's own +charon_mapWithDimensions: check.
#
# The system's AXBrailleMap has no public initialiser, so there is no counterpart to compare a sized map
# against. This builds the port's class alone, with no Accessibility framework linked, and asks it the
# questions the two-sided case cannot ask: that the map comes back the size it was handed, that every pin
# of a grid reads back, and that two sized maps do not share one.
#
# The run.sh that calls this does not diff anything against it, and a probe that were compared against
# something that does not exist would be a check of nothing - so it prints its own answers and a caller
# that wants to see them changed reads the log.
