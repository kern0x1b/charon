# protocol-check.sh - can a caller find every protocol this library's registry claims, by the name the
# registry gives it?
#
# Two things come from the registry and nothing comes from a copy in this file:
#
#   * the NAMES, read out of registry/Accessibility's rows of kind "protocol" and status "implemented"
#     with python3, one macro each, into names.h;
#   * the SOURCES, written by modules/apple/backports.lua's own protocol_sources() - the function the
#     build calls, with the build's argument order - and compiled as it wrote them, one file per release.
#
# That is what makes a row naming a protocol that does not exist turn this red. The generated source for
# such a row is a forward reference, which clang makes a label and which links cleanly, so nothing in the
# build or the link complains; the name is in the binary and no caller can find it. So the check looks up
# every name the registry holds, and a name that does not resolve is the failure. The control is a name
# the registry does not hold, which must answer nil - without it, a check that said yes to everything
# would pass.
#
# It is a port-only program and not a second half of the differential, and the reason is recorded as an
# owed line in this directory's README.md rather than in a comment: see there.
