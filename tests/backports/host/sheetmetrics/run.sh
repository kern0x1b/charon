# run.sh - holds the constants the port's sheet takes from UIKitCore 16.0 (packages/a/apple-backports/UIKit/
# UISheetPresentationController.m, read from that file here, not copied) against what the host's own sheet metrics
# answer under Mac Catalyst. The host is a later UIKit: where it agrees, the value has an oracle besides the read of the
# 16.0 cache; where it differs for a known reason the difference is named and checked, so the test fails if it ever
# stops differing. The layout the port composes from these (frames, the presenter's scale, the stack) has no host
# oracle: the host shows a sheet in a window of its own and has no _UISheetLayoutInfo class to drive.
