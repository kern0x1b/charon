#!/bin/sh
# run.sh - the port's -[NSString sr_sensorForDeletionRecordsFromSensor] against the host's own, in two
# processes, with the mutation layer that makes the comparison falsifiable.
#
#   1. the port's own category is COMPILED and LINKED into the differential, which prints what it answers
#   2. the reader is COMPILED and LINKED separately, opens the host's SensorKit and prints what it answers
#      for the same fifty inputs
#   3. compare.py puts the two side by side, input by input
#   4. three plants: every answer the wrong shape, the nil half removed, and the suffix appended twice -
#      each must turn the comparison red, and each must name the rows it broke
#   5. the comparator's own control: a HOST file with no rows must be red, so a run that compared nothing
#      cannot look green
#
# Two processes, and not one, because both sides are a category on NSString. In one process whichever
# loaded last would win and the port would be compared with itself - which is exactly what the fifty
# inputs are there to prevent being mistaken for agreement.
