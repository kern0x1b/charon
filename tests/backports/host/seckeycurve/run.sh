# OpenSSL prints the private scalar in the fewest nibbles it needs, and with a sign pad on the top byte,
# so its printed length is not a constant: 66 digits when the top byte is 0x80 or above, 64 when it is
# 0x40..0x7f, 62 when it is below 0x40, and so on. The check further down used to accept 64 and 66 and
# nothing else, and failed the run on a key OpenSSL had printed correctly - measured on a key whose top
# byte was 0x0f, which printed 62 digits. So the number is normalised here, once: the leading zeros that
# are not part of the number go, an odd count gains one, and what is left is left-padded to the 64 digits
# of a 32 byte scalar. Anything longer than 66 is a real failure and not a formatting one.

# The port's own four public functions, renamed, so the differential holds the port's code and not only
# the wrapper it calls. TWO files hold them between them: SecurityFunctions10_0_1.m owns the four public
# names and Security/SecKeyElliptic10.m holds the curve for the keys this package makes itself. They are
# compiled together and linked together, which is what the library's own link does - and the reason they
# are compiled with the same four -D renames is that the four names are defined once between them, and a
# second definition is what the 6.1.3 gate refused:
#
#   duplicate symbol '_SecKeyCreateSignature' in: Security/SecKeyElliptic10.o and Security/SecurityFunctions10_0_1.o
#
# The private entry points of the release's keychain (SecKeyCopyPublicBytes, SecKeyCopyAttributeDictionary
# and the rest) do not exist on the host, and neither does the keychain half of the release-key path:
# an in-memory key is in no keychain, so the release's own SecItemCopyMatching answers errSecItemNotFound
# for every one of them (measured, attrs.m in the evidence of this suite's design). port-shims.h answers
# both shapes from the host's own Security, and the differential says which key is of which kind.
