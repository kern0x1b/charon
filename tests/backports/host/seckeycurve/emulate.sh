# tests/backports/device/seckey-ecraw.m in the emulator: what the release's own Security does with an
# elliptic key, which is the release side of facts/Security/SecKeyElliptic.md. One heavy job - a build
# and an emulated boot of 6.1.3 - so it runs in a slot of the machine:
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/host/seckeycurve/emulate.sh
# The log is left in $SECKEYECRAW_BUILD, and the lines that matter are the ones that begin "release ".
