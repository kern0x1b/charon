"""The public members of a class, from clang's AST over its own header.

The first version of the shape check took the member list out of the headers with regular expressions,
and that is where a selector nobody declared came from: a regex cannot tell a method declaration from
a property's accessors the way a parser can, and it cannot tell an instance method from a class one.
So the list is taken from clang instead, which is the same front end the port's own sources are
compiled by -- the answer is the header as the compiler reads it, not as a pattern reads it.

Three things come out of the AST that a text scan cannot give:

  * **the full selector**, so `initWithURL:callbackURLScheme:completionHandler:` is one member and not
    three, and a one-part `initWithURL:` is not a member at all;
  * **instance or class**, so `+new` and `-init` are different members of the same class;
  * **`NS_UNAVAILABLE`**, which is an attribute on the declaration. A method the release marks
    unavailable is not asked about as something the port must have: it is asked about as something that
    must NOT be callable, which is a different question and the one the header is actually making.

Usage: members.py <headers-dir> <class> [<class> ...]
Prints: <class>\\t<selector>\\tinstance|class\\tavailable|must-be-unavailable
