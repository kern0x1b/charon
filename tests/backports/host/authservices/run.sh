# run.sh -- the host differential for AuthenticationServices' surface shape, with a mutant.
#
# **The member list comes from clang**, not from a pattern: members.py runs `clang -ast-dump=json` over
# the class's own header and takes its ObjCMethodDecls. That is the header as the compiler reads it, and
# it is the only source that gives the full selector -- initWithURL:callbackURLScheme:completionHandler:
# is one member and initWithURL: is not a member of anything -- which class or instance, and whether the
# release marks it NS_UNAVAILABLE. The first version used regular expressions and produced a selector
# nobody declared.
#
# **Both sides are answered from a runtime view.** The host's own copy of the framework, asked with
# class_getInstanceMethod and class_getClassMethod by hostshape.c. The port's built library, read out of
# the linked binary's method list by portshape.py -- the port's objects are armv7 and this host is arm64,
# so the library cannot be dlopen'd here and its method list is read out of the file instead. Reading the
# port's *source text* was the earlier mistake, and it invented a selector the file does not contain.
# An inherited method counts on both sides, which is the control: +new comes from NSObject.
#
# **A class the registry carries and whose header cannot be found is an error.** There is no table here
# to be left out of, which is what let a class be asked about one member and pass.
#
# The port's library is built from this worktree's own sources into .agent-work/runs/, so the port side
# measures the tree and not a gate's older binary.
