# values.sh -- what a request HOLDS, as against what it BINDS.
#
# run.sh reads the binary and asks whether a member is bound. A value is not a method, so this is the
# second instrument: it runs the code. Two builds of the same source in one process -- the host's own
# classes, named as the SDK header names them and linked from the framework, and the port's, which this
# process never names because the port's own build renames them.
#
# The renames are on the port's translation units only, never on values.m: a test compiled with them
# would be asking the port's version of the question and calling it the host's.
#
# How a request is made is the whole thing. ASAuthorizationRequest's header marks -init and +new
# NS_UNAVAILABLE because a request is not constructed -- it comes from a provider, and the SDK gives the
# path: [[ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider alloc] init] createRequest, which needs no daemon, no network
# and no UI. The port's provider is not implemented yet, so the port's request is made with alloc/init,
# which the port binds because its own header does not mark it unavailable. Two constructors, one per
# side, and the report says which.
#
#   sh values.sh               measure, exit 0 only when the two builds hold the same values
#   sh values.sh --mutate      change the port's default operation and require a difference

# Before anything is built or run: the host half must not name any of the four methods that write this
# Mac's AutoFill state. Two halves, and they are different in kind, so they are named separately:
#
#   the STATIC half   host-write-guard.py walks the probe's statements and requires every writing
#                     selector to be dispatched inside one chokepoint, port_store_send(), or inside the
#                     table that chokepoint compares against, and nowhere else. It is a reader, and it
#                     is here to catch a send made anywhere else; it is NOT what stands between this
#                     machine and its AutoFill state, because a probe sends selectors as strings
#                     through a cast objc_msgSend and a reader cannot see that.
#   the RUNTIME half  port-store-selftest.m asks the predicate the chokepoint uses -- the receiver's
#                     class name out of the runtime -- about this Mac's own
#                     ASCredentialIdentityStore class object, with the four selectors as strings and
#                     nothing sent. This is the half that protects the machine, and it does not depend
#                     on reading any source.
