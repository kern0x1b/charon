/* hostshape -- what the HOST's own copy of a framework answers for a class's members.
 *
 * The host side of the AuthenticationServices shape check, and nothing else: the port's side is read
 * out of the built library by portshape.py, because the port's own objects are armv7 and this host is
 * arm64 -- a library built for another architecture cannot be dlopen'd here, so its method list is read
 * out of the file rather than asked of a runtime that could not load it.
 *
 * Both sides are answered the same way in principle: from the runtime's own view of the class. Here
 * that is class_getInstanceMethod and class_getClassMethod on the class the framework was opened from,
 * so an inherited method counts as present -- which is the control the coordinator asked for: +new comes
 * from NSObject and is visible here, so a port that also inherits +new agrees rather than being reported
 * as missing one.
 *
 * Usage: hostshape <cases-file>
 * cases: <class> TAB <selector> TAB instance|class TAB available|must-be-unavailable
