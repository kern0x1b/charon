"""host-write-guard -- refuse to start a host differential that would WRITE to this Mac's AutoFill.

On a Mac, ``ASCredentialIdentityStore``'s four writing methods change the **user's** AutoFill state:

    -saveCredentialIdentities:completion:
    -removeCredentialIdentities:completion:
    -removeAllCredentialIdentitiesWithCompletion:
    -replaceCredentialIdentitiesWithIdentities:completion:

A differential that called them to see what they return would be writing to the reviewer's passwords.
The host side of this family is therefore read-only: only
``-getCredentialIdentityStoreStateWithCompletion:``, and only because it asks the system what it already
holds. The writing half's behaviour is documented from the header, not measured on this Mac, and the
port's own save-then-query runs against the port's own store under ``.agent-work/runs/``.

**The rule is about the receiver, not the name.** The port's own store case does call
``-replaceCredentialIdentitiesWithIdentities:completion:`` -- that is the test the coordinator asked for
-- and it sends it to ``PortASCredentialIdentityStore``, which is the port's class and writes the port's
file. A send to the unprefixed class is the host's and is refused.

**This file tests that per LINE, and it says so.** `code_statements()` drops the comment lines and
returns the rest, and `main()` looks for the unprefixed class in what is left. The property is therefore
narrower than "no send outside the chokepoint" -- that is `writing-selectors-scan.py`, which reads the
four selectors by name and has the allowlist -- and this one answers the other half: a probe that cannot
even NAME this Mac's store cannot hold it. **An earlier version of this docstring claimed a per-statement
test that `main()` never made:** `statements()` was written, correct, and unreferenced, while the
per-line reader was what actually ran. The reader is gone and this paragraph describes the one that is
there, because a comment that describes a check is worse than no comment when the two disagree.

The two earlier versions were the same mistake as the unreferenced reader: the first refused on the name
alone and would have made the port's own store case impossible; the second compared line by line and
caught a selector on a continuation line. Both read where a word is rather than what it is called on.
