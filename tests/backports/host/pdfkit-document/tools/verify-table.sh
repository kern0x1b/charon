# It regenerates the twenty-two fixtures, asks the HOST's -[PDFPage string] for each, builds the table
# the facts file claims, and diffs the two.  A difference is printed and exits 1 - including a row that
# is in the file and not produced, and a row produced and not in the file, which is how two of the
# twenty-two went missing once: the tools built four fixtures and the table listed twenty-two rows.

# the table as the facts file states it: the markdown rows are split on the bars and the backticks
# stripped, because a sed pattern over three backticked columns is one more way to match nothing and
# call it a check - which is what the first version of this line did: it extracted ZERO rows and the
# row-count guard fired, which is the guard working, but only after a wrong extractor.
# NOTE the missing s/\\n/…/: an earlier version converted the table's two-character \n into a real
# newline before comparing, which split the three rows that carry one into a second line beginning
# "beta" - and those three were the "25 rows" the row-count guard reported.  Both sides already hold
# the literal two characters, so nothing needs converting and nothing should.
