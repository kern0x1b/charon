// The port's single-section biquad held against the host's own vDSP.
//
// **The oracle is the filter's output, because both setups' insides are hidden.** `vDSP_biquad_Setup` and
// `vDSP_biquad_SetupD` are opaque on the host and the port's own struct is not part of either API, so there is
// nothing to compare in a setup itself. What is observable, and is the thing a caller depends on, is what comes
// out of the filter afterwards. So every case builds a setup on each side from the same coefficients, runs the
// same input through each, and compares every sample.
//
// The inputs are the ones that can tell the readings apart: the five coefficients are distinct and not in
// ascending order, so a swapped b1/b2 or a wrong sign shows; a **second call follows every first one** on the
// same setup, so the delay values are exercised and a filter that reset its state would differ; and the input is
// neither flat nor alternating, so a filter that passed the input through would differ.
//
// The refusal cases are the setup's, since that is all a setup can refuse: no coefficients, and a section count
// that would overflow. Both sides must agree on which of those answers NULL.

// gives several different 32-sample float answers for the same filter and the same input, so there is no

// The check this gates is the port's own half of the statement: the port is scalar C over the caller's own
// buffer, so its answer must be the same at every offset. A port that had picked up a vectorised path, or
// that read anything outside the caller's arrays, would fail here - and this run's four recorded
