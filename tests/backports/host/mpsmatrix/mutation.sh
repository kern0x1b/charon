# mutation.sh — can this harness fail, and can the grader rank? One term of the multiply accumulation
# is changed, the run is repeated, and the grader's own counts must move; the revert must move them
# back. A comparison that cannot fail is not a comparison, and one that cannot tell a one-unit
# difference from a 94 %-wrong answer is not a measurement either.
#
# Two things are true of the campaign and both were false of the one it replaces:
#
#   * It mutates a COPY of the library. The copy is made once under .agent-work, the run is pointed at
#     it with MPS=, and every restore is a copy out of a pristine one. No tracked file is written at
#     all: a run interrupted between a mutation and its restore used to leave the tree changed, and a
#     script that can leave the tree changed does not belong on a shared worktree.
#   * Every mutant is named. mutate.sh reads the anchor and the replacement from
#     mutants/<site>.anchor and mutants/<site>.repl, so no shell parses C source and no anchor in this
#     file can fall out of step with the file it names - which is what happened: the inline anchors this
#     replaces had drifted from MPSMatrixBatchNormalization12.m and the campaign could not start.
#
# The count a mutant has to move is the grader's summary line, not a byte-exact count of differing
# cases: that count read 58 before the SoftPlus fix and 58 after it, so a mutant wrong by 94 % did not
# move it. The line carries all three numbers - identical, within the bound, beyond it - and a mutant
# that is a wrong answer moves the third.
