"""rank.py - grade each case of the mpsmatrix differential by how far apart it is, not only whether.

The comparison in run.sh is byte-exact over whole case lines, so it can say that a case differs and
cannot say by how much: a one-ulp difference in the last place and a 94 %-wrong answer are the same
line of output. This reads the two transcripts, decodes each case's result buffer as little-endian
float32 with a four-byte stride - which is what every case in mps-cases.m prints, the
integer-valued ones included, so a case whose elements are codes rather than numbers is
graded by the distance between the codes and not excused by being one - and grades the
pair:

    identical   every bit the same
    ulp         the two sides differ, but no element is more than ULP_BOUND units in the last place
    non-ulp     some element is further apart than that, or one side is zero and the other is not

An ulp distance is measured on the ordered integer image of a float, so it is defined across zero and
across the sign, and a value of 0 against 5.2e-09 is 5 000 000 000 units rather than a division by
zero. A case that is graded non-ulp is a claim about the port that is not reproduced, so it must
appear in the owed file with its reason; one that is not in that file fails the run.

    rank.py <system-prefix> <port-prefix> <ulp-bound> [owed.tsv]

Exit 0 when nothing is non-ulp and unexplained, 1 otherwise.
