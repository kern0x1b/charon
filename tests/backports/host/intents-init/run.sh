# run.sh - the host's own answer for -[<class> init] on all 110 classes the registry carries a row
# for, measured fresh every time and compared against a golden file.
#
# This is the harness the 110 registry rows name as owed. Each of those rows says the header marks
# the class's -init unavailable, the system still answers one, and `[[Cls alloc] init]` returns an
# object with every property nil. Eight classes had been measured by hand; the other hundred and
# two were "the same rule applied to the same header, which is a claim and not a measurement until
# that harness runs". This runs that harness.
#
# THREE RUNS, in this order, and each one is worthless if the one before it did not pass:
#
#   1. provenance - the controls. It looks up NSObject, NSString, INCar and INListCarsIntent and
#      fails if any is missing, and prints the forwarding trampoline beside three real IMPs. Every
#      zero init.m reports is only the host's answer once this has shown the same reader finding
#      the classes that are there. INCar is in the control because its header says
#      API_UNAVAILABLE(macos, tvos) and a reader that trusted that macro would skip it.
#   2. the differential - all 110 against expected.txt, one line per class.
#   3. the plant - the same binary with PLANT=one-wrong, which must FAIL. A comparison that cannot
#      fail is not guarding anything, so the plant is run and the script stops if it passes.
#
# Build from scratch every time, so nothing stale is ever measured. The build lives under the
# worktree and not in /tmp: nothing this project builds goes to /tmp.
#
#   sh tests/backports/host/intents-init/run.sh
