/* NSTermOfAddress against the system's own, in one process.

   The port's class is compiled under a name of its own (uikit2/renames.sh with "*", which renames the
   classes and leaves the selectors), so the two never meet and each answer can be held beside the
   other. The expectations are the ones facts/Foundation/NSTermOfAddress.md states, which are the ones
   the review measured against the host: the three gendered terms are three distinct singletons with
   no language and no pronouns; +currentUser is a singleton equal only to itself; a localized term is
   equal to another with the same language and the same pronouns, different when the language differs,
   and different again when the pronouns are an empty array rather than nil; equal terms hash alike.

   This harness is what the delivery did not have, and the review is right that it is the missing half
   of the evidence: the band had measured the *host only*, which is why -isEqual: and -hash sitting on
   the state class went unnoticed for four commits.

   IT DOES NOT BUILD YET, and the first error is worth the space:

       packages/a/apple-backports/Foundation/CharonTermOfAddress.h:39:1: error: duplicate interface
       definition for class 'NSTermOfAddress'

   The cause is the rename, and it is not obvious. renames.sh rewrites NSTermOfAddress to
   CharonHostNSTermOfAddress *everywhere*, so on the host the umbrella's own declaration and the one in
   CharonTermOfAddress.h both become CharonHostNSTermOfAddress. The header's guard cannot tell the two
   builds apart: __has_include(<Foundation/NSTermOfAddress.h>) is false in the host's build -- the class
   reaches the test through the umbrella, and no such file is reachable by that path -- so the port's
   declaration is compiled where it is not needed. The port's own build is the opposite: 16.4 has the
   class nowhere, and the declaration is the whole reason the file compiles.

   So the guard has to be a test of the *build SDK's* version rather than of a file, something like

       #if defined(__IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED) && __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED < 170000
       ... the declaration ...
       #else
       #import <Foundation/NSTermOfAddress.h>
       #endif

   and that is one edit plus a run of both builds, which is the next piece of work rather than
   something to guess at here. The expectations below are the ones the review measured and the facts
   file states, so the harness is complete apart from that line. */
