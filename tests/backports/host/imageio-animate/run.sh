#!/bin/sh
# run.sh: the PORT's CGAnimateImageAtURLWithBlock and CGAnimateImageDataWithBlock against the HOST's own
# ImageIO, case by case, with mutations planted to show the comparison can go red.
#
# WHY TWO BINARIES AND NOT ONE: a function has one name in both libraries, so linking the port's object and
# the host's ImageIO into one program cannot happen. Each build answers the same cases over the same fixture
# files - write-gifs.m writes them once, before both builds, so the input is one input - and this script
# compares the two outputs line by line.
#
# THE ANIMATION IS ASYNCHRONOUS, which the comparison has to respect: the host answers the call before the
# first frame is drawn (measured, and cases.m records it), so each build prints the calls that arrived while
# a run loop was given room to run them. A call that has not come is printed as a line anyway, as "-", so the
# two builds always print the same number of records and a call only one of them made is a value in a line
# both printed.
#
# A difference is only allowed where known-differences.txt declares it, with the case name spelled exactly.
# An undeclared difference fails; a declared difference that stops differing fails too, because then the
# declaration is stale.
