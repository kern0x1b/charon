# run.sh - which of SRSensorReaderDelegate's ten methods the port's reader actually sends, with the
# mutation layer that makes the answer falsifiable.
#
#   1. check_delegate.py reads the port's own SRSensorReader.m and names all ten, SENT or NEVER
#   2. it must find exactly four SENT, exactly the failure callbacks the reader's own bodies send, each
#      carrying SensorKit's own inaccessible-data error, and the authorization answering denied
#   3. the same four read back out of the COMPILED armv7 object, which is what the linker binds
#      @selector() against and therefore what a device would exercise
#   4. four plants, each of which must turn the source check red: a send removed, a send swapped for one
#      of the six nothing should send, the authorization no longer denied, and a reader that sends
#      nothing at all - the last being the check's own control, red for a different reason than the
#      first three. The second of those is also carried through the object, so the object check has a
#      plant of its own rather than agreeing with the source check by construction
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A DIFFERENTIAL, stated here rather than left for a reader to discover. There is no
# behavioural oracle for SRSensorReader on this machine and that is measured, not assumed: the host's own
# SensorKit.framework declares the class and implements nothing (respondsToSelector: is 0 for
# +authorizationStatus and +sharedReader), and the port's CharonSensorKit.h cannot be compiled against
# the host's newer SDK at all - clang answers "typedef redefinition with different types ('NSInteger'
# vs 'enum SRAcousticSettingsSampleLifetime')" for the fifteen enumerations it redeclares, because the
# host's SensorKit spells them NS_ENUM. The armv7 object is the port's own answer, built the way the
# 6.1.3 band builds it.
#
# What this does NOT claim: that a device reaches a subscriber. The call test on the emulator has not
# been run and facts/SensorKit/SensorKit.md says so.
