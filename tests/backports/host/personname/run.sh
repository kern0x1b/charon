# The port's class is compiled under a name of its own (uikit2/renames.sh with "*", which renames the
# classes and leaves the selectors alone, so each side has a class of its own and the two never meet),
# which is the mechanism a class the port implements itself needs: a category's selectors would have
# to be renamed as well, and a -D rename would rename the same selector in an SDK header.
