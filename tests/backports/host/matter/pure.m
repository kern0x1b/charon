/*
 * The parts of Matter an application meets first, held against the host's own framework.
 *
 * Commissioning, reading and writing an attribute on MTRBaseDevice, and MTRDeviceController: the first three things
 * a program does. What is here is what of those three the host can be asked with no device on the other end, because
 * that is the only part that can be held to a reference at all:
 *
 *   - the setup payload, built from a passcode and a discriminator and read back; the manual-entry parser over the
 *     eleven decimal digits of that payload; the onboarding-payload parser over its base38 form; a payload that is not
 *     one, so the failure answer is compared too and not only the happy path; and the commissioning parameters' own
 *     defaults, which a program reads before it has a device;
 *   - the shape of the three areas' classes and of MTRDeviceControllerStorageClasses(), which needs no controller.
 *
 * The output is one "name<TAB>answer" line per question. The port's answers are the same file built against
 * libMatterBackports.dylib and run on the emulator; tools/matter-pure-diff.lua compares the two files and names every
 * line that differs.
