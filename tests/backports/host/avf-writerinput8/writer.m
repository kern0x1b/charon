//  writer.m
//  The 8.0 multi-pass writer input, asked once and compiled twice.
//
//  THIS ONE FILE, TWICE:
//
//    the host half   compiled with the real <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h> and linked against this
//                    machine's own AVFoundation. Every answer is Apple's own, and this half is the ORACLE:
//                    the expectations the port is held to are read from it and from nothing else.
//    the port half   compiled with -I standin, so <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h> is the stand-in release -
//                    an AVAssetWriterInput with no pass machinery, an AVAssetWriter whose -startWriting
//                    means something - and linked with packages/a/apple-backports/AVFoundation/
//                    AVAssetWriterInputMultiPass8.m UNMODIFIED. The port's categories land on the
//                    stand-in's classes and the answers are the port's own.
//
//  Why the stand-in and not Apple's classes with the port linked over them: this Mac's AVAssetWriterInput
//  carries the whole 8.0 family, and the port's guard would - correctly - refuse to install over a release
//  that has it, so a link against the real classes would test the guard and nothing else. The stand-in is
//  shaped like the release the port runs on, which is what the family is written for.
//
//  Because the sequence is ONE source, the two halves cannot drift: every row is asked at the same point
//  in the same order, so a difference in a value is a difference in behaviour and a difference in a ROW is
//  a difference in the sequence itself, which run.sh reports rather than hides.
//
//  Three configurations, because the header makes the family settings-dependent and the port's answer
//  differs between two of them:
//
//    switch-off   the default: -performsMultiPassEncodingIfSupported is never set.
//    switch-on    it is set to YES before the writer starts. Apple's own class answers YES to
//                 -canPerformMultiplePasses and runs a real second pass; the port answers NO, which is
//                 the difference the port's file writes down and run.sh's ALLOWANCES name.
//    only         no member of the family is called at all and the pass is ended with the release's own
//                 -markAsFinished, which is what a 6.1.3 client does.
//
//  Every row is printed as `key | value` so a harness can join the two tables on the key without parsing
//  prose, and a value is never inferred: each one is what the object returned or what it raised.

// the call to -startWriting", :504 says after -markCurrentPassAsFinished "After the receiver analyzes
// whether an additional pass is warranted, the value of currentPassDescription will change (usually
// asynchronously)", and :492 says the block "will be invoked one final time so the client can invoke
// -markAsFinished in response". So the deliveries this harness depends on are the release's own promises,
// and the only question left is WHEN to look. The two waits below are how, and neither is a sleep:
//
//   * charon_wait_for_calls waits on a semaphore the block signals, with a deadline. It answers "did the
//     promised invocation arrive", and reports NO when the deadline passed.
//   * charon_settle waits for the promised invocations and then for a QUIET interval with no further
//     one. That is what "the analysis has finished" looks like from outside: with the switch on, Apple's
//     class may nominate a second pass or may not, and which one it does is its own answer - but either way
//     there is a last invocation, and until a quiet interval has passed the harness has not seen it.
//
// THE BOUNDS ARE MEASURED, not chosen to make a run pass. On this machine, with this Mac's own class, the
// invocation after -markCurrentPassAsFinished arrives 3 ms after the call when the machine is idle and 11 ms
// when four other heavy host tests are running beside it (measured over five rounds of eight each,
// .agent-work/runs/w-avf4/load-timing.sh). The quiet interval below is twenty times the worst of those, and
// the overall bound is generous enough that a missed delivery is a fact about the run rather than a fact
// about the timing.
//
// AND A RUN THAT MISSED ONE SAYS SO. Every count the waits decide is printed through
// charon_count_value, which prints the marker instead of a number when a promised delivery did not arrive,
// and run.sh refuses to cache a host table carrying that marker. A table whose count is a race is not a
// measurement, and the earlier version of this harness cached one: the coordinator's gate read
// "currentPassDescription after markAsFinished host=[{0/1,0/0}]" and
// "markAsFinished after the final pass invocation host=[RAISED NSInternalInconsistencyException]" from a
// table built once under load, and every later run in that tree reported unexplained=2.
