# ONE source, writer.m, compiled twice: once with the real <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h> and this
# machine's own AVFoundation - the ORACLE, from which every expectation is read - and once with -I standin
# and the port's own packages/a/apple-backports/AVFoundation/AVAssetWriterInputMultiPass8.m linked in
# UNMODIFIED, against a stand-in release shaped like the one the port runs on.
#
# The join is not "nothing differs". Every row falls into one of three classes:
#
#   must match   both halves answer it and they must agree. A difference is a failure unless ALLOWANCES
#                names it, and ALLOWANCES is a short list of differences in the PORT's build, each with
#                the measurement that explains it.
#   answers less the host answers it and the port does not. Always a failure.
#   row missing  one half printed a row the other did not. Always a failure: the sequence is one source,
#                so a row that is there on one side only is a difference in the run and not in the code.
#
# **Directionality.** The check is not "nothing differs" but "a mutation must turn a RIGHT answer wrong".
# A mutant run is judged against the port's own unmutated table and must show all three of: a row that
# CHANGED, a change on a row that was RIGHT (it matched the host before the mutation and does not after),
# and a red verdict overall. "RIGHT" is measured against the host table, so a mutation whose only effect is
# on a row that was already allowed to differ cannot be accepted by it - which is what the MOVED TOWARD HOST
# lines report when they appear, and they do appear: the `finalcall` mutation drops the port's invocation
# count from 2 to 1 on a switch-on row where the host's own answer is 1, so it agrees MORE closely with the
# host there while breaking five rows that matched. A control runs each mutant's UNMUTATED source through
# the identical build-and-run path and must stay green, so a red mutant is the mutation and not the path.
#
# The host table is built once and cached beside the build directory, which is removed on every run; a
# baseline that a run deletes is a baseline no mutant can be judged against.
#
# Not run through heavy.sh: it compiles four small files, links two binaries and runs them, and the
# fleet's heavy lane is for the gate.
