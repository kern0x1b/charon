#!/bin/sh
# run.sh — the notification/key/option constants of slice avf-1, the port against the host.
#
# One program (probe.m) linked twice. Linked plain, every name is Apple's own exported symbol and the
# table it prints is the host's. Linked with the rename list and the port's four objects, the same
# names are the port's own definitions and the same table is read out of them. The two tables are
# diffed.
#
# The harness COMPILES the port's sources, LINKS them beside Apple's, and READS the port's object.
# Three things that gives which reading the sources would not:
#
#   * a name the port does not define is a LINK ERROR, so a missing constant cannot read as "both
#     sides absent and therefore equal";
#   * the value and the bytes are both compared, and a value that is not valid UTF-8 answers NULL from
#     -UTF8String, so text alone would print "(null)" on both sides and pass;
#   * a run that compared nothing fails. The row count is asserted on both sides and against the count
#     this slice claims, so an empty table is a red and not a clean diff of two empty files.
#
# The mutant is the check's own falsifiability, and the control is what says the red is the mutation:
#
#   AVFMUTANT=1            perturbs one value by one byte and the diff must go red on that row
#   AVFMUTANT=1 CONTROL=1  runs the UNMUTATED source through the identical build-and-run path and must
#                          stay green
#   AVFMUTANT=1 BREAK=1    breaks a file so it does not compile, which must be RUN FAILED and exit 1:
#                          a build failure is never a noticed mutation
