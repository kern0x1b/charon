#!/bin/sh
# run.sh — the avf-3a descriptor classes, the port against the host.
#
# One program (probe.m) linked twice: plain, where every name is Apple's own, and with the rename list
# and the port's five objects, where the same names are the port's own classes in the same binary.
# The two tables are joined row by row.
#
# Run DIRECTLY, not through heavy.sh: this is a handful of small compiles, and the gate is heavy.sh's
# job for the package builds, not for a probe.
#
# What makes it a check rather than a comparison:
#
#   * a name the port does not define is a LINK ERROR, so a missing class cannot read as "both sides
#     absent and therefore equal" - the failure AVMetadataItemFilter had as a bare category;
#   * the row count is asserted on both sides and against the count this probe emits, so an empty
#     table is a red and not a clean diff of two empty files;
#   * the harness is PLANTED, twice, and this is the part that says the harness works: the probe can
#     corrupt its own answers, and the run must notice. plant-all must go red on every row, plant-one
#     on exactly one. A run that passes while the probe is corrupting every answer is not a check;
#   * a mutation that does not build is RUN FAILED with the compiler's line and exit 1, so a build
#     failure is never counted as a noticed mutation;
#   * the CONTROL runs the unmutated source through the identical build-and-run path and must stay
#     green, so a red mutant is the mutation and not the path.

# THE ROW COUNT IS NOT TYPED HERE. It used to be, twice, and the two literals did not agree with the
# comment above them: the comment said both sides emit the SAME 49 rows, the assertions said 63, and
# the worktree had by then moved to 71. One export carried all three numbers, and the reviewer's first
# finding was this file contradicting itself. Typing 71 would have made it contradict itself again the
# next time a row was added, so the number is now DERIVED from the run: the probe ends every run with
# "rows: N", and the expectation is what that probe says it emitted on that side.
#
# The two sides stay SEPARATE numbers because they are the two SIDES of one claim - a table that
# silently lost rows on one side would not otherwise be noticed - and the probe asks both builds the
# same questions, so they are expected to match without that being assumed. Some rows have no host
# oracle - the 12.0 initializer, which this host's criteria factory cannot build - and the join holds
# those against the port's own unmutated baseline rather than against the host.
#
# If the probe does not report its own count there is nothing to check against, and this says so and
# stops. It does not fall back to a number, because a fallback is how 49, 63 and 71 got here.
