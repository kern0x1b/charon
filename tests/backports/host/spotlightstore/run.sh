# run.sh - builds the port's CoreSpotlight sources on the host, with CHARON_SPOTLIGHT_SHARED_ROOT moved into the build directory, and
# runs store.m against them: a write refused by the file system (the store's directory without write permission) and a write allowed
# after it. The host's own CoreSpotlight.framework is not linked, only its headers are read, so the classes are the port's.
# search.m does the same with the search bundle's CharonSearchDatastore.m added, reading a store into which entries no indexing
# application would write have been put. Then mutants of the rollback, the cause and the reading, which the checks must tell apart.
