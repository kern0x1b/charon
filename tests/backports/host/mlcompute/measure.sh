# The measurement the layers family is written against, asked of the host's own MLCompute and printed
# so that it can be read and compared rather than believed. Neither program is a test: they ask, they
# record, and they exit whatever the framework's own answer is. What the answers are is written down in
# facts/MLCompute/Engine.md and facts/MLCompute/Layers.md, and the differential holds the port to them
# once the port has the layers.
#
# engine.m asks what the framework computes for a layer, through an inference graph so the numbers come
# from its own arithmetic. factories.m asks what the layer factories keep, and refuse, and name.
