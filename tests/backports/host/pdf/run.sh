# run.sh — differential host test for the PDF renderer. The backported sources are compiled for
# Mac Catalyst with their classes renamed, so the backport and the system renderer stand side by
# side in one process: both draw the same document, and what each produced is compared page by
# page - the page count, each page's media box, and the pixels of each page rasterised at a known
# scale. The bytes of the two files are never compared: a PDF carries a creation date and an
# identifier, so two documents that say the same thing never match byte for byte.
