# THE WHOLE NSURLSession FAMILY, DISCOVERED, not a list kept beside it. Six of the fourteen were named here
# and two of the eight that were missing broke the run in turn, in the two ways a missing source does: the
# link said `Undefined symbols _charon_network_cellular` (CharonNetworkAccess.c defines it, and it is the
# port's own C helper, a file of its own for the reason its header gives), and then, with that linked, a task
# answered -delegate with doesNotRecognizeSelector: because -[NSURLSessionTask delegate] lives in
# NSURLSessionTask+Delegate15.m, a category nothing had pulled in. A category is reached through objc_msgSend,
# so no linker error names it: only the sources decide. The family is fourteen files and every one of them
# belongs to the framework this harness compares, so all fourteen are built and the next one is picked up.

# the port defines for itself in CharonStreamTaskState.m - a class no SDK header declares, so it carries a name
# of its own that has nothing to do with the session. It is named here because the LINK is what finds a missing
# one: a class is reached through objc_msgSend and only an undefined _OBJC_CLASS_$_ symbol names it.

# ... and the port's plain C with them: a C function shared between backport files lives beside neither of them,
