# run.sh - what Apple's own MediaPlayer answers for MPNowPlayingInfoLanguageOption's two "automatic"
# accessors, measured on this machine. It needs no arguments and reads nothing outside this directory.
#
#     sh run.sh
#
# The binary is removed BEFORE the compile, so a compile that fails cannot leave the last run's numbers
# on screen to be read as this one's - which is how two earlier runs of the other probe in this tree
# reported values its source had never produced. The probe's own two controls are checked here rather
# than trusted: without them a framework that had dropped the type, or that did not declare the
# initialiser at all, would print a table of NOs that reads like a measurement.
#
# This is a READ of Apple's behaviour, not a check of the port: the port's own check is
# tests/backports/host/mediaplayeritem/languageoption90.m, which compiles the port's source against the
# stand-in header so that what is measured is the port and not this Mac's MediaPlayer.
