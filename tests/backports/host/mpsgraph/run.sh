# run.sh — is this port's MPSGraph the same arithmetic as the system's own?
#
# graph-cases.m is compiled twice: once against the system's own MPSGraph, and once against this port's
# classes with the MPSGraph names mapped to Charon names and their selectors prefixed, so the port's
# implementations are reached under names of their own and cannot replace the system's. Each of the two is
# run ONCE PER FAMILY, one process each, and every case prints the bytes of a buffer the case owns, so the
# two runs of a family are compared exactly.
#
# A family is a process because the release makes it necessary, and the measurement is written down in
# facts/MetalPerformanceShadersGraph/Core.md: in a process that holds three hundred graphs the release's own
# gather operations start asserting partway through the family — "Error: NDArray dimension length > INT_MAX"
# (MPSNDArray.mm:831) over a flatten of a 2x4 that answers in a program of its own — and every FED gather
# parameter takes the process down whatever else it holds. So each family is run, compared and judged on
# its own, and the check of the recorded cells is scoped to the cases that family actually ran: a cell
# another family recorded is not in these two runs, and reading it here would report a divergence that has
# gone away.
