# run-rows.sh - the two harness builds of tests/backports/host/intents/ against the system's own
# Intents, in one binary and one process, with the controls and the negative control run.
#
# init-rows.m is the per-class harness facts/Intents/Intents.md names as owed: it reads, for every
# class of init-classes.txt, what the system's own class answers for -init through the IMP, because
# the SDK's header forbids naming that selector at compile time and the port's own emitted body is
# built around the same restriction.  factory-rows.m reads the six release-13 rows of
# registry/Intents/ios16.json that the file listed as absent with a reason about a group of the
# delivery.  intents12-rows.m reads the twelve members of the iOS 12.0 group that the generator
# writes by hand, including whether each completion handler runs before the call returns.
#
# BOTH PROGRAMS LINK -framework Intents, and that is not decoration.  A first attempt at
# factory-rows.m read the four classes with NSClassFromString from a program that did not link the
# framework and got ABSENT for every one of them: the reader was blind, not the host.  A measurement
# whose reader is blind looks exactly like a measurement of an absence, so both programs print a
# class the system does not carry and the harness has to report ABSENT for it, and this script runs
# that list and fails when the harness passes it.
#
# The four classes are API_UNAVAILABLE(macos) in the SDK, so factory-rows.m reaches every one of
# them through the runtime and reads every value through KVC; a program that named them would not
# compile, and a program that read them with NSClassFromString without linking -framework Intents
# answers ABSENT for all four and is wrong about every one.  Each section is a separate run, so a
# section the host cannot answer does not take the other three with it.
