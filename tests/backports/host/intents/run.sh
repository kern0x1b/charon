#!/bin/sh
# run.sh - the port's 83 Intents extern constants against the system's own Intents, which exports
# every one of them, in one binary and one process.
#
# constants.m is linked twice over. Linked with the port's seven IntentsConstantsNN.m objects, each
# name resolves to the port's own definition; linked without them, each name resolves to the
# framework's. The program refuses an answer that came from
# /System/Library/Frameworks/Intents.framework and reads the port's through dladdr, so it cannot
# compare Apple's Intents with itself and call the two equal - which is what it did before that
# check, printing "83 lines, 0 red -> PASS" with no port object in the link at all.
#
# Three things this checks that a value-inspection would not:
#
#   * a value the port gets wrong shows up as a diff, not as a comparison against itself;
#   * the seven objects are one per release rung, and dropping one reds exactly the names that
#     object holds - 26, 38, 3, 3, 9, 2, 2, which is the split tools/intents/emit-intents-constants.py
#     writes and the split backports.lua's band() requires;
#   * PLANTS=one-wrong puts a value in the table the system does not have and every check that would
#     have passed must fail. A test that cannot fail is not guarding anything, so this script runs
#     that build too and fails when it does not.
