// The value of every constant this port carries, measured from the host's own MediaPlayer and compared

// The iOS 6.1.3 cache exports NONE of the 31 MediaPlayer constants, read with the tools in
// charon/tools, which is why the port carries every one of them. That is a per-row fact in the registry,
// not an assumption here, and it is what makes this band's values Apple's to carry.
