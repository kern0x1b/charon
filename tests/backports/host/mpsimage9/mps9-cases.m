// mps9-cases.m - the three MPSImage kernels SDK 16.4's headers mark ios(9.0), against a plain C
// reference computed in this process from the release's own header formulas.
//
// ONE build, covering all three kernels: MPSImageIntegral, MPSImageIntegralOfSquares and
// MPSImageSobel, over a set of shapes and channel counts chosen so each rule in the object is
// exercised. Compiled twice, normal and with a plant, so the comparison has to be seen to fail.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO SYSTEM BUILD HERE, and why that is not a gap. This host's AGX family does not
// implement computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:, and the release's own MPSImage kernels die encoding
// with '-[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer mtlnext computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:]': unrecognized
// selector. The release answers nothing on this machine, so the oracle is the header's formula in
// mps9-reference.h and every row for these three says so. Comparing the port against Apple's MPS
// binaries belongs in a harness that builds them, on a host where they run.
//
// Three modes, and the second two exist so the grader is known to be able to fail:
//   normal        the port's own arithmetic
//   all-wrong     every value printed is replaced by a constant, so every element of every case differs
//   one-wrong     every value but the first of the first case is right, so the grader has to name one
//                 wrong element rather than a case
//
// The port's classes are renamed through a header generated from the classes THIS build's objects
// actually define, which is what makes the MPSImage and the answer the port's own rather than the
// release's class reached by accident.
