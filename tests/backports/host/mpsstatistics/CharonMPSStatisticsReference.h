// CharonMPSStatisticsReference.h - the reference the MPSImageStatistics kernels are checked against,
// in plain C.
//
// WHAT THE REFERENCE IS, and what it is not. It is the header's own sentences turned into arithmetic:
//   MPSImageStatistics.h:18  "computes the minimum and maximum pixel values for a given region of an image"
//   MPSImageStatistics.h:19  "min value is written at pixel location (0, 0)"
//   MPSImageStatistics.h:20  "max value is written at pixel location (1, 0)"
//   MPSImageStatistics.h:66  "computes the mean and variance for a given region of an image"
//   MPSImageStatistics.h:114 "computes the mean for a given region of an image"
// It is written independently of MPSImageStatistics11.m - it takes the source values and says which
// kernel to compute - and it never names the port's class, so a case that agrees is two
// implementations of one sentence and not one implementation compared with itself.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: a claim about the release's own numbers. This host's AGX family lacks
// computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType: and the release's own kernel dies encoding with
// '-[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer mtlnext computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:]': unrecognized selector,
// so there is no oracle for the release here and no number below is one. What the cases establish is
// that the port's walk is the header's sentence, element for element.
//
// THE BOUND, and why it differs by kernel. A minimum and a maximum SELECT values the source already
// holds, so they are exact and are compared for EQUALITY - a copy that moved a bit is a copy that moved
// a bit, and a tolerance here could only hide it. A mean and a variance divide, and dividing cannot be
// exact in binary, so each sum is taken in double and divided ONCE and the answer is within one whole
// float32 ulp of the truth. That is the same split mps-reference.h and CharonNNReduceReference.h state
// for the reduce families, applied here rather than reinvented.
//
// WHERE THE PAIR GOES is the header's sentence for the min/max (:19-20) and this file's choice for the
// mean/variance pair, which the header does not place: along the first row, mean then variance. The
// choice is written into the port's rows and it is the SAME choice here, so the two agree by
// construction and the cases below do not pretend the header settled it.
