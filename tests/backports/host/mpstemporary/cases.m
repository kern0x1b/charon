// cases.m - what a temporary IMAGE's read count does when a kernel reads it, and what the release's
// own MPS answers for the same question on this host.
//
// The same file is compiled twice: once against the system's MetalPerformanceShaders, once against
// this port's classes with their MPS names mapped to Charon names (run.sh's rename header), so the
// port's own MPSTemporaryImage and its own kernel are the ones being asked. The two transcripts are
// NOT compared, and that is the finding rather than a gap: the release cannot make an
// MPSTemporaryImage on this machine at all, so it has no answer to compare with and the case prints
// the selector it raises. What IS checked is the port's own contract, written down below from
// MPSImage.h:1030-1036, and run.sh plants a build without it and requires the plant to fail.
//
// THE CONTRACT, from MPSImage.h:1030-1036 - "each time a MPSTemporaryImage is read by a MPSCNNKernel
// -encode... method, its readCount is automatically decremented":
//
//   1. a fresh temporary answers the count it was given, so a zero can never come from a dead reader
//   2. readCount 2, one encode that reads it -> 1
//   3. a second encode -> 0
//   4. a PLAIN MPSImage through the same kernel is left alone: MPSImage.h:1051 declares readCount on
//      MPSTemporaryImage and on no other image, so there is nothing on it to decrement
//   5. the destination holds the kernel's own arithmetic over a source of 1.0, which is the control
//      for the reader: a kernel that refused would leave the count where it was and checks 2 and 3
//      would both read as a pass
//
// TWO OMISSIONS THAT ARE MEASURED, not convenient. There is no -commit and no
// -waitUntilCompleted, because this host's own Metal cannot commit either and the transcript says so
// with the selector - -[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer_mtlnext commit]: unrecognized selector - and the
// port's kernels walk their images on the CPU inside -encode..., so the count has moved by the time
// -encode... returns. The image is ONE feature channel, because MPSImageThreshold13.m refuses a
// multi-channel image by name (MPSImageThreshold.h:18-19 turns the channels into one luminance it
// does not implement) and a refusal would leave the count where it was.
