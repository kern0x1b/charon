/* The four names a stream task's transaction reports about the socket underneath it, against the host's own.

   The port's classes are compiled under names of their own (uikit2/renames.sh with "*", which renames
   the classes and leaves the selectors), so the two sides never meet and each answer can be held beside
   the other. The listener is this test's own: a plain TCP socket on the loopback the kernel gives a port,
   which accepts the connections the tasks below open and holds each one open, so what is compared is what
   each side REPORTS about a socket both of them opened to the same place.

   WHERE THE SYSTEM'S OWN ANSWERS COME FROM, and why not from a stream task. Measured on this host,
   2026-10-04, in a process with no port object in it at all, over a listener of that shape:

     - the host's own stream task DOES finish, and what finishes it is this side: -closeRead and
       -closeWrite together, which in the same millisecond bring URLSession:readClosedForStreamTask:,
       URLSession:writeClosedForStreamTask: and URLSession:task:didCompleteWithError: with the task's
       state already 3. -cancel finishes it too (state 3, NSURLErrorDomain -999). The LISTENER's close
       alone does not: the task sat at state 0 for three seconds with its listener gone.
     - and for that stream task URLSession:task:didFinishCollectingMetrics: NEVER fires. Nine endings,
       six of which complete the task with no error at all, and no transaction in any of them.
       -captureStreams ends the delegate messages by its own contract ("When that message is received,
       the task object is considered completed and will not receive any more delegate messages"), so a
       stream task has no shape on this host in which a transaction arrives at all.
     - the same delegate, the same session and this same listener DO get one out of a DATA task, 7 ms
       after its resume: 127.0.0.1, the ephemeral port, 127.0.0.1, this listener's port, and nil for both
       negotiated TLS values, because there is no TLS on the connection.

   So the left side of every row below is the system's own transaction over this listener, taken from the
   task the system collects metrics for - and the run prints, as a note, that the stream task on the same
   listener delivered none. The oracle is the system's answer; nothing here stands in for it.

   The port's members go onto the class the host's own session instantiates, and the host's own answers
   are read before that happens: that class is the class of a task the host made, so reading them
   afterwards would compare the port against itself. The order is the measurement, not a style. */
