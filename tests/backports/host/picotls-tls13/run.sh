# One TLS 1.3 handshake between two picotls connections, to prove the TLS stack the port builds for
# a QUIC handshake is usable.
#
# The C is the same on both sides of the port: picotls's own sources, compiled here for the host
# because a pump that has never run is a guess, and for the device by the same recipe the package
# builds it with. Where the sources come from is the installed package when there is one and a
# checkout of the pinned commit when there is not, so this runs before the package is ever built.
#
# The certificate and the key are made here, by the host's own openssl, into the build directory: the
# port's tree holds neither, and both are thrown away with the directory.
