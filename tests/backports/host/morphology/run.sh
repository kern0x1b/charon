# The morphology family against the host's own: the port's five classes renamed with -D beside the host's five, in one process,
# over the 172 cases in expected.txt. Build from scratch every time, so nothing stale is ever measured.
#
# Before anything is built, two greps on the one file that holds the class, the description and the 17.0 side table. A
# -description that prints a bare number for the eight settings is the form the port had for two commits, and it came back twice
# through a rewrite that was meant to change something else; the first grep says the eight name tables are still there and the
# second says the %ld form is not. Either failing stops here, before a binary exists to be run.
