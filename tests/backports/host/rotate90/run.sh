# vImage's quarter turns held against the host's own, sample for sample, over twelve shapes and both
# destination shapes for each. The port's sources are compiled with every API name they define renamed, so
# this translation unit can hold the port's answers and the host's side by side; the names come from the
# port's registry, so a name added to either file is renamed too.
