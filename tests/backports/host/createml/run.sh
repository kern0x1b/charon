# The port's CreateML against the host's own CreateML, in one process.
#
# The port's sources are compiled under the module names `PortCreateMLComponents` and `PortCreateML`
# so that Apple's `CreateML` and this port's `CreateML` are two modules declaring the same type
# names, and the differential can hold both in one process. The only edit made to the sources is the
# module's own name: every `CreateMLComponents` becomes `PortCreateMLComponents`, which is the import
# line and every qualified use of the port's own types. The sources keep the qualified spelling
# because it says where each type comes from, and the rename is done here rather than in the sources
# because the sources are the armv7 build's, where the spelling is the right one.
#
# What has to be true for this to be a differential rather than two programs: the same sources, one
# module renamed. What is compared, and what is deliberately not, is in differential.swift's header.

# "the trap is before the print", and was wrong.

# The suites are therefore run with stdout unbuffered, so a print that precedes a trap is evidence.

# The CoreML overlay under a name of its own, so the host's `CoreML` and the port's are two modules

# The header is what gives the module the framework's declarations, exactly as the package's own
# build does: the module is named `CoreML` and so is the SDK's clang module, and two modules cannot
# share a name. `-import-objc-header` puts the header's declarations in the module directly.

# The specification writer is part of the CoreML overlay, not a module of its own: on the device
# `packages/c/createml/xmake.lua` builds every `files/CoreML/*.swift` as the one `CoreML` module, and
# a writer that the package never compiles would be a file only the host test can see. It used to be a
# separate `PortProto` module, which is why `CreateMLComponents` could not see it.
