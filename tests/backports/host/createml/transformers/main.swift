// transformers.swift — the port's feature transformers, against the arithmetic they are named for.

// Not a host differential, for the reason `linearmodels/main.swift` gives: the port's
// `CreateMLComponents` is a module of its own and the host's estimators are declared against a
// `DataFrame` and a shaped array spelled differently, and bridging that is its own work. What is
// checked here is that each transformer does the arithmetic its name says, on data whose answer is
// known by hand, and that the three things they must refuse — a category the fit never saw, a
// constant column, a column with nothing in it — are refused rather than papered over.

    // The robust scaler, against the host's own answers.
    //
    // Every number below came from `probe/robust-scaler-host.swift`, kept in the tree beside this file
    // and re-runnable:  `xcrun swiftc -O -o rsh robust-scaler-host.swift && ./rsh`.  It asks Apple's
    // `RobustScaler` the same questions; nothing here is transcribed from Apple's source.
    //
    // The three facts it establishes:
    //
    //   1. the scale is the **width of `quantileRange`**, not a statistic of the data. The host's
    //      `interQuartileRange` is 0.5 for five integers, 0.5 for 200 skewed non-integers, and 0.5 for
    //      a **constant column** - where a data statistic would be 0. It is 0.8, 1.0, 0.25 and 0.0 for
    //      those widths. Ten cases, `IQR == width` in every one.
    //   2. the median is the data's median, the mean of the two middles for an even count: 2.5 for
    //      `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, 3.0 for `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]`, 37.815 for the 200-value skewed set - each
    //      exact against the hand computation the program also prints.
    //   3. `applied` subtracts the median and divides by the scale, so for `[1, 2, 3, 4, 100]` at
    //      `0.25...0.75` with median 3 and scale 0.5 the column is [-4, -2, 0, 2, 194].
    //
    // The port scaled by `1.4826 * MAD`, so (1) is the substantive difference: a statistic where the
    // host has a configuration value. The review's F1 found `1.4826 -> 2.4826` left 0 failures, because
