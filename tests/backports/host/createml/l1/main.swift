// l1.swift — the evidence behind the L1 refusal.
//
// The port's `LinearRegressor` fits an L1 penalty by the proximal iteration in `Proximal.swift`, and
// this file is the evidence that the fit is a *minimum* rather than a point the iteration reached.
//
// The KKT residual is the right test for a proximal method on a non-smooth objective — zero at a
// minimum, and on a convex objective satisfied only at one — and the **single-weight nudge** is the
// check that has teeth: no single coordinate, moved by a hundredth or a twentieth, may lower the
// objective. An earlier version of this suite compared predictions against the host's with a wide
// tolerance — wide *because* the two implementations' penalties are on different scales (below) — and
// that width was exactly what let a broken solver through. A mutation of the solver passed it.
// So the sharp, convention-free claim is here, and the wide agreement claim is beside it.
//
// The measurement of the host's penalty scale is kept: at no penalty the two agree to nine places,
// and away from zero they solve different problems, which is a fact about the framework and not
// about this port.
