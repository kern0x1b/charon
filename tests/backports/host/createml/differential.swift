// differential.swift — the port's CreateML against the host's own, in one process.
//
// The port's sources are compiled under the module names `PortCreateMLComponents` and
// `PortCreateML` (see run.sh: the only edit to the sources is one import line), so Apple's
// `CreateML` and this port's `CreateML` are two modules declaring the same type names, and every
// number below is the host framework's own answer to the same question the port was asked. Nothing
// here compares against a fixture.
//
// What is compared, and what is not:
//
//   - the table: construction from a CSV, the column types, the sums and the spreads, the sorted
//     order, the four joins, group-and-aggregate, the split sizes, the drops. These are defined
//     operations on values with no freedom in them, so they must agree exactly.
//
//   - the estimators: the *predictions*, row by row, from `MLDecisionTreeRegressor`, which takes an
//     `MLDataTable` — the very input this port takes. A tree grown by one CART implementation and a
//     tree grown by another can pick different splits out of a set of equally good ones, so a
//     per-prediction comparison is only fair where the split is not a matter of taste. The tables
//     below are built so that it is not: a separable step, and a table whose target is a linear
//     function of one feature. Where a row is genuinely ambiguous the comparison is on the metrics
//     and not on the rows, and the file says which is which.
//
//   - NOT compared: the bytes of a trained model, the order of two equally good splits, the depth
//     of a fitted tree, and the seed Apple's own generator consumes. Each is an implementation
//     choice of one release, and holding the port to it would be holding it to a private detail
//     rather than to what a caller can see. The `.mlmodel` export is absent from this build and the
//     `write(to:)` calls are checked to *refuse* rather than to match.
