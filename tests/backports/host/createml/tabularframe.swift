//
// The file is a differential, not a test: Apple's `TabularData` is imported beside the port's
// `PortTabularData`, and the checks that name a host are the ones that compare. A check that
// reads only the port is still worth having — it pins the port's own answers so a host
// disagreement can be attributed — but the two are held together so that a change has to
// move both to be accepted.
//
// This is **not** a differential against the host's `TabularData`. It could not be one yet: Apple's
// columns are collections and the port's are not, because a user-defined collection conformance does
// not compile with this toolchain at all (measured on the port's compiler and the host's, with a
// fifteen-line non-generic conformance as the witness — see `facts/TabularData/Columns.md`), and the
// two APIs therefore differ at the type level in a way a single comparison cannot span. So this test
// holds the port's frame to the *rules* the framework's own documentation states, and the host
// comparison of the values stays a separate piece of work rather than a pretend.
//
// Every number here is the port's own, and each check says which rule it is holding the frame to.

// Unbuffered, so a print that precedes a `precondition` or a bounds trap is still there. Swift's
// `print` buffers on a pipe and a trap kills the process before the flush, so without this a suite
// that traps immediately after a diagnostic print shows nothing at all - and "printed nothing" was
// read as "the trap is before the print", which was wrong.

// here is `PortTabularData.`-qualified, so the two `DataFrame`s and the two `Column`s coexist
// without either shadowing the other. Holding both is what makes this a differential rather than a
// test of the port against itself, and it is the wiring every family in this series needs.
// `@testable` for the members that are internal on purpose: `AnyColumn`'s typed initialisers,
// `presentValues` and `erasedValues` are not Apple's, so they are internal, and the suite reads them

// problem, and they are different fixes. Run it as:
//
//     KEEP=1 ./run.sh && "$TMPDIR"/createml-differential.*/tabularframe --slice-probe
//
// The prints are unbuffered, so whichever read traps still leaves the reads before it on the output.
// The slice cases that are supposed to trap each end the process, so each is its own invocation:

//     kept.index(before: kept.startIndex) -> Fatal error: Can't move index before startIndex
//
// The third case is the consequence: a `reversed()` walk has to reach that same boundary, so it cannot
// be answered without reaching the trap - and a sentinel that leaves the walk in place would instead

// One case first, before the eleven: a nil has to survive into the box's storage. Everything the

//     error: 'nil' is not compatible with expected element type 'Array<Int>.ArrayLiteralElement' (aka 'Int')
//
// That is a compile error, not a failing check, and it is why there are two cases here rather than

// a disagreement to be averaged away.
// Apple's `AnyColumn` has no accessible initialiser - it is reached through a frame, which is the
