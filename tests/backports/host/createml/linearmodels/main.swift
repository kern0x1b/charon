// linearmodels.swift — the port's linear regressor and logistic classifier, against the closed form.
//
// **This is not a host differential, and it is not pretending to be one.** A linear fit over a
// full-rank design with no penalty has exactly one right answer, and that answer is written down:
// a table whose target is `3 + 2*x1 - 1.5*x2` has to fit back to `[3, 2, -1.5]`, and a model built
// from those coefficients has to reproduce the table. That is a stronger claim than "agrees with
// another implementation of the same thing", because it cannot be satisfied by two wrong
// implementations agreeing.
//
// The host comparison — the host's own `LinearRegressor.fitted(to:validateOn:)`, which is
// `async throws` and takes a `DataFrame` — is real work and is not done here; `differential.swift`
// carries the twelve defects this surface's own differential found, and this file is a different
// claim from the same tree.
//
// What is checked:
//
//   - the coefficients of a fit over a table made from a known line, to a tolerance;
//   - the predictions of that model, row by row, against the table's own targets;
//   - that a ridge penalty pulls the slope toward zero by the amount the closed form says;
//   - that a model of the wrong width, a rank-deficient design, and an L1 penalty are each *refused
//     by name* rather than answered;
//   - that the classifier separates a linearly separable table, that its probabilities sum to one,
//     and that the label it answers is the most probable one.
//
// The last of those three refusals is the one that matters most: a fit that silently ignored the L1
// penalty the caller set would hand back a confident number about a model nobody asked for.
