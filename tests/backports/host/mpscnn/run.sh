# run.sh — is this port's convolutional MPS the same arithmetic as the system's own?
#
# cnn-cases.m is compiled twice and run twice: once against the system's MPS, once against this port's
# classes with the MPS names mapped to Charon names and their selectors prefixed, so the port's
# implementations are reached under names of their own and cannot replace the system's. Every case
# prints the result the kernel wrote, as text, and the two runs are compared against a written-down
# float tolerance rather than bit for bit, because a convolution accumulates in a different order on a
# GPU than on a CPU. See TOLERANCE below.
