# The points-of-interest request's own numbers, compared against the HOST's own
# MKLocalPointsOfInterestRequest: the four members' values, for the same circles and the same regions,
# plus the copy the header's own NSCopying promises.
#
# The port's object is built here as a macOS dylib with its class RENAMED, because the class name is
# Apple's and two classes of one name cannot both be live: the rename is the only way both can answer
# the same circle in one probe. Apple's own is reached through the unrenamed name.
#
# THE MUTANT is the same dylib with no recompile -- the runner allocates a subclass at run time whose
# -radius answers the region's diagonal instead of its larger half-span, which is the reading this
# port's first version used -- so a run in which the mutant does not go red means the comparison cannot
# see a wrong number, and this probe fails.
