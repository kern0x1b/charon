// facts/CloudKit/Values.md holds what the port does with them; this file holds where the answer came
// from. Every case is one line, the expectation beside it is the host's own answer as measured by
// running this program against the framework, and the run exits non-zero naming any case whose answer
// is not the recorded one -- so the measurement in the facts is reproducible and a host that changes
// its mind goes red instead of leaving the facts describing another host.
//
// Both spellings of both are asked, and both are asked through objc_msgSend: -init and +new are the
// two a caller gets wrong, and this file compiles against the SDK headers where -init is marked
// NS_DESIGNATED_INITIALIZER, so a direct send would measure the header rather than the framework.
//
// One process, because none of these cases can end it: the two CKOperation spellings raise and are
// caught here, and every other case answers with an object that is never sent anywhere. The one
// initializer in this family that DOES end the process -- +[CKSyncEngine new], which traps in the host
// because the class behind the public one is private -- is in the facts and not here, and that is the
// reason it is not here.

// reason it raises. "absent" is a class this framework does not carry, which is a difference from the
