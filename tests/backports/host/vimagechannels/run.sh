# functions' buffers are declared `VIMAGE_NON_NULL`, and an attributed parameter is assumed non-null inside
# the function, so at -Os a plain `if (!src)` is folded away and the refusal the release makes is simply not
# in the object. Built this way, every case below runs against the same arithmetic the bands link.
