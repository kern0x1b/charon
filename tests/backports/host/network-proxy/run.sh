# The host differential for the objects of Network: the port's own files compiled with every nw_*
# symbol they define renamed to charonhost_nw_*, linked into one program with differential.m, which
# asks the same questions of the port's implementation and of the host's own Network.framework and
# compares the answers.
#
# The rename set is read out of the sources rather than written down, so a call the port adds is
# renamed with it and one the port stops defining drops out of it: a name the program declares but no
# file defines would be an undefined symbol, and the build here would say so. The Charon classes are
# renamed the same way, so the port's objects are not the host's.
