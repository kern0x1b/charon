# run.sh — the NEDNSSettings object, measured two ways, with a mutant per comparison.
#
#     sh tests/backports/host/netext-settings/run.sh [--mutation]
#
# Two binaries, because a host differential can only prove the port's code where the host does not
# answer the same name: linking the port's class into the same process as Apple's NEDNSSettings makes
# one implementation shadow the other, and a comparison that cannot say which one answered is a
# comparison that proves nothing. So:
#
#   host   the probe alone, with -framework NetworkExtension. Every answer is Apple's, and the probe
#          prints a dladdr line naming the image that answered each selector.
#   port   the probe TOGETHER WITH packages/a/apple-backports/NetworkExtension/NEDNSSettings.m, built
#          for the same Mac Catalyst target, with no NetworkExtension linked. Every answer is the
#          port's.
#
# The harness compares the names both sides answer - servers, searchDomains, matchDomains,
# matchDomainsNoSearch, the copy, and the keyed-archive round trip. The three names Apple's class does
# not carry (dnsProtocol, domainName, allowFailover) are not compared against it; they are checked
# against the iOS 26.2 header's own declarations, which run.sh greps, so their oracle is named.
#
# --mutation breaks one answer per comparison in the port's source and each has to go red naming it. A
# mutation that does not build is RUN FAILED and never counted as noticed.
