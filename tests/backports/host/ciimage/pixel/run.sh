# The port's CIImageAccumulator re-implements a class the framework already has, so a process that
# linked both would get the framework's. The port's copy is therefore built here under a name of its
# own and linked beside the framework: the framework's accumulator is in the process and is never
# asked, and the two never touch the same object. The pixel formats and the parameter names come from
# the framework in the port process - the same values the port's own constants carry, over 136 of them
# measured equal to the host's.
