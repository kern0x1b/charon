# NSJSONSerialization of packages/a/apple-backports/Foundation/NSJSONSerialization.m, compiled for the host with the
# class renamed, against the host's own NSJSONSerialization: the whole class (the three 5.0 methods and the two 7.0
# stream methods), every reading and writing rule the file names, the exact wording of every error and exception, the
# position each error carries, and the number each literal comes out as.
#
# Two comparisons are deliberately not exact, each for a stated reason, and both are checked here rather than left out:
#   - the text of a written dictionary without NSJSONWritingSortedKeys (an unsorted dictionary has no order of its own;
#     this host's Foundation sorts, the releases this port carries write the dictionary's own order), and
#   - the position a "too deeply nested" failure carries (the host reports an internal offset, the file reports where
#     the limit was reached); the wording of that failure and whether it happens at all are compared exactly.
