#!/bin/sh
# run.sh — a host differential for SFCertificatePresentation, the one family of this delivery the host
# can be the oracle for.
#
# The host's own Security framework builds the trust and answers it; the port's sheet is asked for the
# same trust and must produce the same lines. The port's classes are compiled under names of their own
# (SFCertificatePresentation becomes CharonSFCertificatePresentation, from the registry's own class
# entries) so that a build which never links the host's SecurityUI still builds, and so the two builds
# are never confused for one another. The host has no SecurityUI of its own in this SDK to compare
# against, which is why the oracle is the trust: every line the sheet shows is read out of the trust
# with Security calls that have been public since iOS 2, so the host's answer to those calls is the
# answer the sheet must reproduce.
#
# Nothing here touches a keychain, fetches a certificate or opens a network: the certificate is a
# self-signed one written into tests/backports/device/certificate-selfsigned.inc, byte for byte, so both
# builds see the same one. The sheet is never presented either - the lines are asked for through the
# very call the presentation makes - so this runs as a plain Catalyst binary with no window and no app
# context, and nothing about the host's own state is involved.
