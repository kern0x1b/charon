# Does the built armv7 module still carry what the facts say it carries?
#
# The facts file for this package states how many of the corpus rows for `Combine` the
# built module declares, and how many it does not, broken down by family. Those numbers
# were written by hand, and a hand-written number in a facts file is a claim, not a check.
# This script computes them - from the same tool the corpus was built with, reading Apple's
# declarations and ours out of the two `.swiftinterface` files - and compares them with
# what the facts say. A mismatch is a failure, not a note: the facts are what the next round
# reads, so if they are stale the next round is reading nothing.
#
# It needs the armv7 module built, and builds it if it is not there: the same swiftc the
# package uses, the same swift-runtime resource directory, through the same three steps.
