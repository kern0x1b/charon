# The differential: does this port's Combine behave as the host's own Combine does?
#
# One source - Harness.swift, Table.swift and main.swift here - is compiled twice, once
# against the host's own Combine and once against the module this port builds, and the two
# runs are compared line for line. A differing line is a place where a caller of the two
# would see something different.
#
# The module is built HERE, from the fork's own sources and this repository's layer, before
# either probe is built against it. That is the whole point: a run that linked a prebuilt
# object would measure the object, so a change to the module's Swift could sit in the
# sources and the run would answer `identical`. A mutation of the source read as a pass,
# which is the one thing this test must never do. README.md has the mutation and what it
# prints.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the module

# The host copy is called CombineKit, not Combine. On macOS the SDK's own Foundation
# imports Apple's Combine, and a module called Combine links Apple's Combine beside it
# through the autolink its interface carries; the two sets of classes then collide. Twelve
# files of the sources name the module's own types with the module's own prefix, which only
# resolves when the module carries that name, so the staged copy has that prefix rewritten
# to the name it is built under. OCombine is a nested namespace of the fork's own whose name
# ends in the same six letters, so it is put aside for the moment the substitution happens.
