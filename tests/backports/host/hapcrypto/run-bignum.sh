# run.sh — checks the bignum HAP's pairing arithmetic is written on, against an independent
# implementation: the cases are generated with Python's pow and the answers diffed.
#
# The two shapes are the point. `pow` is what a modular exponentiation makes, and what the check that
# came first covered: two full-width operands, 32 to 3072 bits. `mul` is what SRP-6a makes and what that
# check never reached: a narrow k, x or u against a full-width v, a narrow value reduced on its own,
# and a 2000-bit value against a narrow one. The defect in `mont_finish` that the second shape found
# is in the tree's history; the first shape passing without it is why both are here.
#
# The cases and the answers are both text, so a failure is a diff and not a judgement.
