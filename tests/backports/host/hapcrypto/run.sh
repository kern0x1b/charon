# run.sh — checks the HAP crypto layer against the published test vector of every primitive it wraps:
# RFC 7748 for X25519, RFC 8032 for Ed25519, RFC 8439 for ChaCha20-Poly1305, RFC 5869 for HKDF and
# FIPS 180-4 for the two hashes. The crypto is C over a vendored Monocypher, so the check is a host C
# program: there is no framework, no SDK and no device in it, and a difference is a difference in the
# arithmetic rather than in a link.
#
# It builds Monocypher out of the TARBALL the recipe pins, which the shared xmake store's package cache
# keeps, and never from the network: what is checked here must be the bytes the package is built from.
# It used to copy packages/m/monocypher/monocypher.c, a vendored copy this tree deliberately does not
# have: the recipe says why in its own comment - "The sources come from Monocypher's own tarball, not
# from a copy in this tree: xmake builds a package in its own source directory, which does not hold a
# vendored file" - so the harness died on "cp: .../packages/m/monocypher/monocypher.c: No such file or
# directory" while the package itself builds from the tarball every day. Re-vendoring the file would
# put back exactly what the recipe removed, so the sources are read where they are.
