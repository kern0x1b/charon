# check-model.sh — what the registry says is implemented against what the library really defines.
#
# The gate's own check is the authority; this is the one you can run in a second before reporting, and
# it exists because a class listed as implemented with no @implementation behind it is a false claim
# that no amount of "it compiles" will catch: an empty .m file compiles clean.
#
# It reads the @implementations of the library's own sources, reads the registry's class and protocol
# rows, and prints the two differences. A row the registry calls implemented and the tree does not
# define is a failure; a class the tree defines and the registry does not list is a failure the other
# way round. Exits non-zero on either.
#
# Usage: sh check-model.sh [<package dir>]   (default: this repository's apple-backports)
