#!/bin/sh
# run.sh — the PORT's CGImageMetadata against the HOST's own ImageIO, case by case, with a mutation
# planted to show the comparison can go red.
#
# WHY TWO BINARIES AND NOT ONE: a function has one name in both libraries. Linking the port's object and
# the host's ImageIO into one program cannot happen (the linker sees the same definition twice), so each
# build answers the same cases and run.sh compares the two outputs line by line. What the port's answers
# come from the port is proved in the PORT build itself, not assumed: cases.m's PORTONLY binding record
# reads dladdr() for every function this slice carries and fails if any of them is still ImageIO's.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT: it is not tests/backports/host/imageio/run.sh, which links the host's ImageIO on both
# sides of every one of its five checks and so compares the host with itself. Nothing in this tree compared
# the port's CGImageMetadata with anything before this file.
#
# A difference is only allowed where known-differences.txt declares it, with the case name spelled exactly.
# An undeclared difference fails; a declared difference that stops differing fails too, because then the
# declaration is stale and a reader would trust a difference that is no longer there.
