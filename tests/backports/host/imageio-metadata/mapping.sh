# run.sh — the two measurements the next band of this family needs, re-runnable, with their controls.
#
# NEITHER OF THESE CHECKS THE PORT. Both measure the ORACLE, because what was missing was a fact about the
# host: what CGImageMetadataCopyTagMatchingImageProperty answers for every (dictionary, property) pair the
# iOS 16.4 header declares, and what CGImageMetadataSetValueMatchingImageProperty does with the same pairs.
# run.sh asserts the counts it measured so a change in the host's own behaviour is visible rather than
# silent, and it prints both numbers and the controls beside them. The port's own differential is run.sh's
# neighbour, run.sh in this directory's parent, which binds the port's object and can fail.
#
# ONE PAIR PER PROCESS, and that is the measurement method rather than a workaround: the host TRAPS
# (SIGTRAP, exit 133) on CGImageMetadataSetValueMatchingImageProperty for most pairs, so a trap is an
# answer of its own - the host cannot answer for that pair - and only a process per pair can record which.
