# table.sh: the HOST's property-to-tag table, measured over every (dictionary, property) pair the SDK's
# CGImageProperties.h declares, one process per pair, with the controls that say the numbers mean something.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES, which is the whole input of the table in packages/a/apple-backports/Graphics/
# ImageIOMetadata7.m: for each pair, what tag the host's own CGImageMetadataSetValueMatchingImageProperty
# writes, and what its own CGImageMetadataCopyTagMatchingImageProperty then answers for that pair. The
# names are the host's answers and nothing here decides what a property maps to.
#
# IT CHECKS THE ORACLE, NOT THE PORT. run.sh in this directory's parent is the differential: it builds the
# port's own object and the host's ImageIO into two programs and compares their answers case by case. This
# script's job is to say that the oracle's own numbers have not moved, so a table that stops matching is
# either a port defect or a change in the host, and this run says which.
