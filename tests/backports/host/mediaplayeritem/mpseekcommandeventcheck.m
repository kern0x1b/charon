// MPSeekCommandEvent's contract: the class is a kind of the base the port carries, the base's command
// answers what the event was built with, the property reads back what was set for each of the
// enumeration's two cases, and an event nothing set answers the type's zero.
//
// Unlike its two siblings this check includes the port's whole 7.1 object rather than one class's own
// file: MPSeekCommandEvent's @implementation is inside MPRemoteCommandCenter71.m beside the other nine
// classes that arrived in 7.1 and cannot be included on its own. What is measured is still the port's own
// code -- the base's -initWithCommand: and -command and MPSeekCommandEvent's -type are the port's, not
// this file's copy of them -- and not this Mac's MediaPlayer, which has no MPSeekCommandEvent at all.
//
// The mutation's verdict is printed by hand on both sides, because mutate.py cannot enforce that:
//   python3 tests/backports/host/mediaplayeritem/mutate.py MPRemoteCommandCenter71.m \
//       "return _type;" "return 0;" <scratch>
// then compile this file with -I<scratch> in place of the library directory. The two verdicts must differ.
#import "MPMediaItemStandin.h"
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

// The stand-in declares the 9.0 event's option type and three of the command classes as interfaces
// only; a class whose symbol is referenced needs a body at link time, which is the same defect
// MPMediaItemStandin.h's own UIImage note records.
