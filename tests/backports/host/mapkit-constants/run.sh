# The value of every constant this port carries, measured from the host's own MapKit and compared
# with what the port carries. The values in the port's five constant object files were read out of
# the host the same way; this is the test that says they still are, and it fails the moment a name
# is missing from the host's framework, so a value the port invented cannot pass.
#
# The two lists come from the port's own constant files, so the probe covers exactly what the port
# carries. The port's objects are compiled with each name renamed to charonHost_*, and Apple's own
# MapKit answers for the unrenamed name beside it: the two values are therefore in one process, one
# from this port and one from Apple's own framework, and compared.
