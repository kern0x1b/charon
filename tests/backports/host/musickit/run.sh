# The end-to-end check for a minted Apple Music developer token: mint one from a key generated here
# and ask OpenSSL to verify the signature over the first two parts joined by a dot, which is what a
# JOSE verifier does.
#
# It exists because the two checks this module has are not enough on their own: the C differential
# proves the signature, and a base64url unit test proves the encoding, and neither can see a token
# that is well formed in each half and wrong as a whole. This can - and did, three times.
#
# The module is built for the host with the toolchain's own macOS Swift, because the port's
# swift-runtime ships its standard library for iOS only. The C the module reaches is compiled for the
# host here for the same reason.

# uECC's *sources*, at the commit packages/m/micro-ecc/xmake.lua pins. They are not in the installed
# package - it ships include/ (headers) and lib/ (the archive), and the archive is armv7 because the
# recipe builds it for the device, so a host link cannot use it either. The three paths this run tried
# before - include/uECC.c and two guesses beside the package - all miss, and the error was "no such file
# or directory". A clone of the pinned commit is the same bytes the recipe builds its archive from, and
# it is the same thing the other two suites that need the curve do (microecc/run.sh, seckeycurve/run.sh).
