# The twenty-one activation types, asked of the host's own MLCompute and of the port's engine, and the two
# answers compared line by line - then a mutant of the port that has to be told apart from it.
#
# The engine for the host is built from the CPU backend's own source list at that commit, C and C++, and
# the dylib links the C++ runtime. That is the harness only: the release build compiles the five C units
# and is clean in both bands, because on armv7 the kernels are in the C.
#
# The port side goes through a dylib, not a program linked against libggml.a: the archive is compiled
# -fvisibility=hidden so the engine is never API of an image that links it, and a program cannot bind to a
# hidden symbol in a static archive. The dylib is built the way the gate builds the library - the port's
# own translation units, every name renamed, the archive linked in, hidden visibility throughout - and this
# one CharonMLC entry point is what crosses the boundary.

# The comparison, case by case, on the bits of each float. Bit-identical is the rule for nineteen of
# the twenty-one cases, and the two exceptions are named with the size of their exception, measured:
#
#   tanh, tanhShrink - the framework's own tanh is one ulp off the correctly rounded value at 1, where it
#   answers 3f42f7d5 and tanhf, tanh in double and tanhf in double all answer 3f42f7d6; its tanhShrink
#   subtracts that value, and the subtraction is what carries the error from one ulp to four at 1. So the
#   two bounds are one each, and each is the case's own measurement.
#
# It is per case and not one number for the file because a number wide enough for those two would be
# wide enough to hide a wrong constant: 0.797885f - the rounded spelling of the GELU's own multiplier,
# and what this file carried until the review measured it against the framework's descriptor - costs two
# ulps on the GELU, and a rule of four anywhere would pass it. With the GELU held to zero the wrong
# constant fails, and the mutant below is that exact value.
