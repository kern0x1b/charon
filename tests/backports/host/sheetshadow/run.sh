# run.sh - asks the host's UIKit and Core Animation, under Mac Catalyst, what UIKit's "magic" sheet shadow is made of, and
# holds the port's shadow (packages/a/apple-backports/UIKit/CharonSheetShadow.c) to it: the vibrant colour matrix 16.0
# gives it (-[_UIShadowView _updateShadowVisualStyling], with the lower intensity the sheet's drop shadow view sets) takes
# its colour from what lies behind the layer, over red, blue, grey and white, and a view's alpha scales it; the port's
# matrix and cap insets are the host shadow view's, its generated image is _UIPopoverShadow, and its pixel leaves what the
# filter leaves. A colour matrix that makes the layer red is the control that the capture shows filters at all. The
# host's image along an edge and its matrix go where device/sheet-cases.m reads them.
