# Two builds of the SAME probe: once against the port's class, once against the framework's own.
# The host Mac has a real NSBatchInsertRequest from the same header, so the two runs are the same
# questions asked of two implementations, and the verdict is the diff between them.
# Nothing is persisted: the store is NSInMemoryStoreType, and there is no CloudKit here.
# The PORT binary renames the class, with -DNSBatchInsertRequest=CharonBatchInsertRequest, because it
# links -framework CoreData and the runtime answers "Class NSBatchInsertRequest is implemented in both
# CoreData and .../differential-port" otherwise: two definitions of one class, and which one answers
# is not the run's to choose. check.sh's header records this and per-initializer.m is built both ways
# under it; this probe is built the same way, so the port side asks its own class the same questions
# the host side asks the framework's. That is also why the port's -init raises with the reason text
# spelled out rather than through NSStringFromClass: a class-name substitution would print the renamed
# class where Apple prints NSBatchInsertRequest.
