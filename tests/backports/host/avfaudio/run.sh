# avfaudio — the host behaviour check for the AVFAudio audio-unit family.
#
# Two halves. The first asks the *host's own* real AudioUnits the same questions the port asks its unit,
# so a difference is a difference in the port: the tail time a unit really has, the properties the
# header names, a description that names nothing, whether a narrow read of a Float64 property is
# accepted. The second is a source check over the port's own code, for the things only the port can get
# wrong - a wrong value type, a property invented, a fallback that substitutes a component.
#
# A run that instantiates no host unit fails rather than passing vacuously: the oracle has to be there.

# The offline-render differential is its own program: it asks the host's own 3D mixer and the host's
# own offline engine, and it needs neither the port's sources nor an SDK, so it is built and run first
# and its verdict is part of this script's.
