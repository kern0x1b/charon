// port.m — the port's own classes, beside Apple's, in one binary.
//
// The port's sources are compiled with every class name they define renamed (port.sh), so this file
// can hold charon_host_AUAudioUnit and Apple's AUAudioUnit to the same question and compare the two
// answers. That is the check round 3 found missing: with a harness that called only Apple's classes,
// a mutation of the port's channelCapabilities left everything green.
//
// The comparison is over numbers, statuses and refusals — the things a differential can settle — and
// not over pointer identity or Apple's private state, which the port has no business knowing. Where
// the port answers something the host declines to, both answers are printed and the check asks
// whether the port's is consistent with the release, not whether it is equal to the host's.

// The port's own class names, as the rename left them. Declared here rather than imported, because
// the port's headers declare Apple's names and this file is asking about the renamed ones.
