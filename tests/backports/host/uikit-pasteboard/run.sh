# The port's two UIPasteboard categories, LINKED against a stand-in for the release's own UIPasteboard
# and READ back: what the port asked of the release's primitives, and what it recorded for the two
# options the release cannot honour.
#
# The stand-in declares the RELEASE's surface - the selectors its selector table holds on 6.1.3 and on
# 4.3, and the type lists that are its own symbols - and records every call. The port's real objects
# are compiled unmodified and linked against it, so a call the port sends to the wrong receiver raises
# here, which a single-file compile cannot see.
#
# Two plants, each of which must make this FAIL: the stand-in MISREPORTS what it was told, so a check
# that compared only its own expectations would go green with a plant in place. all-wrong misreports
# every line; one-wrong misreports the one line about the type the release's list holds.
