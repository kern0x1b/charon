#!/bin/sh
# run.sh - the five value-object members, held to what the host's own SensorKit answers and to what the
# compiled armv7 objects carry.
#
#   1. host-answers.m asks the HOST: both counts over all ten sentiment categories, both speech
#      properties, and what -[SRSensorReader init] does. host_answers.py holds those answers to what the
#      SDK's own semantics require - zero, nil, and a raise - so a golden that has drifted is red
#   2. check_values.py holds the PORT: each of the five is a store-backed accessor in the source, and its
#      selector is in the compiled armv7 object
#   3. four plants, each of which must turn step 2 red: a property reading a constant instead of the
#      store, a count reading a constant, a count that drops the category from its key, and an accessor
#      deleted outright
#   4. the check's own control: an object with none of the five selectors must not look green
#
# WHY THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIAL, and this is measured rather than assumed. SRKeyboardMetrics,
# SRSpeechMetrics and SRFaceMetrics are all API_UNAVAILABLE(macos) in the host's SDK, so a typed call
# cannot name them, and the port's CharonSensorKit.h cannot be compiled against that SDK at all - clang
# answers "typedef redefinition with different types ('NSInteger' vs
# 'enum SRAcousticSettingsSampleLifetime')" for its fifteen redeclared enumerations. What the host
# answers is therefore measured once, in step 1, and the port is held to it; and the port's own half is
# held twice, in the source and in the object, because a source check alone would pass on a method the
# compiler never emitted and an object check alone would pass on one that returns a constant.
