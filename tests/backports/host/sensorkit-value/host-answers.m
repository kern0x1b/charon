// The HOST's own answers for the five value-object members, measured once and printed, so the port's
// answers have something to be equal to.
//
// This is the only part of this harness that touches the host, and it exists because the other part
// cannot: SRKeyboardMetrics, SRSpeechMetrics and SRFaceMetrics are all API_UNAVAILABLE(macos) in the
// host's SDK, so a typed call cannot name them and the port's CharonSensorKit.h cannot be compiled
// against that SDK at all. What the host does answer is this, and it is worth writing down:
//
//   - both counts answer 0 for all ten SRKeyboardMetricsSentimentCategory cases,
//   - both speech properties answer nil for a metrics object with no session,
//   - and -[SRSensorReader init] RAISES NSInternalInconsistencyException with the message
//     "Use initWithSensor:", which is Apple's own text and the reason that row stays absent.
//
// The interfaces are written here rather than imported because the imported ones are unavailable, and
// the receiver comes from objc_getClass for the same reason. performSelector: is NOT used for the
// counts: it carries an NSInteger return as garbage, which measured as ten lines of "(nil)" here before
// the declarations were written out, and a garbage number read as zero would have agreed with the port
// for the wrong reason.
