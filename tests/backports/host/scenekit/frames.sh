# frames.sh <scenes> <frames> : the port's SCNView frames of Telegram's star2 and coin against macOS SceneKit's.
# <scenes> holds star2.scn and coin.scn (Telegram's PremiumUI resources, decompressed) with their images. <frames>
# holds, for each scene S, what device/scenekit-frames.m wrote on a device at 256 points:
#   S-full.png          scenekit-frames S.scn 256 S-full.png noparticles
#   S-drawn.png         ... noparticles nosubdiv noclearcoat nonormal
#   S-wrongD.png        ... noparticles roughness+D, D = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 (a renderer a little wrong)
# It prints, in compare.py's terms (IoU, mean, p95): what the switches cost on macOS alone; S-drawn against macOS's
# frame of the same switched scene, which holds nothing the port does not draw; S-full against macOS's frame of the
# scene as it is; each S-wrongD against macOS's switched frame. It checks one thing: S-full and S-drawn are identical,
# the switches taking away nothing the port draws. No bound on the frames is set yet (facts/SceneKit/SCNView.md,
# "The frame tolerance"). Run it through coordination/heavy.sh (it renders with Metal).
