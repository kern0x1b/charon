"""compare.py <oracle-dir> <device-dir> : holds the port's animation series (tests/backports/device/scenekit-animation.m)
to macOS SceneKit's (series.swift through record.sh), case by case.

A sample passes when it lies within a tube around SceneKit's curve (its samples joined by straight lines): 5 ms across
in time and, in value, 1e-3 for a node's values and one level for a pixel. SceneKit's own samples sit up to 3.5 ms
off the curves they follow, the time stamp of a sample being taken just before the frame that evaluates it; a second
run of SceneKit against a first stays within the tube. The shimmer group begins at media time 1.0 and repeats every 4 s,
so it is compared by phase ((abs - 1) mod 4), not by time since the add. While an animation runs its samples are held to the
tube; after it, to the value SceneKit settles on; its end, to SceneKit's within the larger sampling gap and 5 ms. The
delegate's calls must match in order and flag, and in time within 20 ms (a frame and a sleep). remove-midway is
removed by the test's own clock, so there only the part before the removal and the value after it are held.

A series that is empty, cut short, or whose values do not parse fails: every sample carries all the oracle's columns, the
running samples begin where the oracle's do (and end there, when the end is timed) within the device's largest sampling
gap and 5 ms, a running sample beyond the oracle's span by more than that is outside, and the series lasts as long as
the oracle's (compare_test.py holds this).

The negative control: the device's series must NOT pass against the -mutant cases, SceneKit's own series of the same
animation a little wrong (duration 5% long; a spring 22 stiff instead of 21)."""
