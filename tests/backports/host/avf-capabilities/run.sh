#!/bin/sh
# run.sh -- the capture-device capability members the port carries (iOS 17 and 17.2), the port against the
# host's own camera, in one binary and in one process.
#
# The same shape as tests/backports/host/avf-globals' controls phase, for the same reason: the port's code is a
# CATEGORY on AVCaptureDevice and AVCaptureDeviceFormat, and those are APPLE's classes on this host. A copy
# compiled here unchanged would replace Apple's own implementations in this process and the probe would be
# comparing the port against itself. So the copies are renamed at their @implementation lines and land on
# stand-in owners this build declares (charon_host_AVCaptureDevice, charon_host_AVCaptureDeviceFormat), while
# the category names stay, so a category the port spells differently still fails to compile.
#
# WHAT MAKES IT A CHECK AND NOT A COMPARISON:
#   * the member list is read from the port's registry, never typed here, and every row of it must be answered
#     on both sides: a member one side does not carry is a red;
#   * every answer is compared against expectations.tsv, which carries BOTH columns - what this host's camera
#     answers and what the port answers - and the reason where the two differ. The hardware differs (this
#     camera has reaction effects, an iPhone 4S has not), so "the two columns are equal" is not the claim;
#     "each column is the one the table names, and the port's is the answer for the port's devices" is;
#   * the two CLASS properties are read out of the APPLICATION's Info.plist, so they are asked four times
#     with four plists the harness writes itself, and the expectation for each run is COMPUTED from the plist
#     that run used. That is the check that the rule is the rule and not a constant in either direction;
#   * the run is PLANTED and the plant must go red, and CONTROL=1 puts the unmutated sources through the
#     identical path and must stay clean;
#   * a mutation that does not build is RUN FAILED, never a noticed mutation.
#
# Run DIRECTLY: three small compiles, four small runs.

MEMBERS

# THE PROLOGUE: the stand-ins with the same categories the port's sources implement, and nothing else. The
# port's OWN members are NOT declared here: what the port's copy carries is asked of the port's copy through the
# runtime, and a prologue that declared them would answer that question itself.
#
# What IS declared here is the stand-in device list, because the port's preferred-camera pair asks the release
# for its devices: `[AVCaptureDevice devicesWithMediaType:]` and `[AVCaptureDevice defaultDeviceWithMediaType:]`.
# On the real target those two are the RELEASE's own functions over the release's own cameras (which is why the
# port calls them instead of naming a position), and here they are modelled over a list this build hands them -
# which is what makes "the most recent camera is gone" askable at all.
#
# The stand-in device carries an activeFormat too, because -setAutoVideoFrameRateEnabled: asks the release's own
# -activeFormat and then this port's AVCaptureDeviceFormat category before it accepts or refuses a value, and a
# device with no format could not answer that at all: the refusal would be the probe's crash rather than the
# header's rule.
#
# The three macros at the end are what route the port's OWN call sites to the stand-in: they rename the class name
# everywhere in the copied source, in a method body as well as at an @implementation line, so the port's code
# asks the stand-in and not Apple's camera. The control that this is happening, and not the probe talking to the
# stand-in behind the port's back, is the preferred-camera phase: its steps change with the list this run hands
# the stand-in, which only the port's own code can do.

# THE COPIES: the port's own header import is dropped, because on this host its @interface AVCaptureDeviceFormat
# category would collide with the macOS SDK's own declarations and its forward declarations are Apple's business.
# The class name is NOT rewritten here: the prologue's macros do it, in a method body as well as at an
# @implementation line, so the port's own `[AVCaptureDevice devicesWithMediaType:]` reaches the stand-in. Each
# copy is asserted to carry the owner lines this harness was written against, as WHOLE WORDS - a count of
# substrings would also match the port's own header import and prove nothing. The third field is that header's
# own file, and its import is asserted to occur exactly once before it is dropped: Python's str.replace on a
# missing needle is a silent no-op, and a "copied" run over a copy that lost its import would then be asked a
# question about a file that no longer is the one this harness was written against.
# The fourth field is how many bodies of the copy are expected to send a message to a renamed class, so the
# "the macros have something to rename" assertion is not applied to the format-only object, which has none.
