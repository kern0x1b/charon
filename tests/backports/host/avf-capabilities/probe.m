/* capabilities.m - the capture-device capability members the port carries, the port against the host, in ONE
 * binary, in one process.
 *
 * The host HAS this API (iOS 17 and macOS 14 added the reaction surface, this macOS is 27) and this Mac has a
 * camera (measured: "MacBook Pro Camera", AVCaptureDeviceTypeBuiltInWideAngleCamera, seven formats), so every
 * row below is something the host answers. What the two sides do NOT necessarily agree on is the capability
 * itself: this camera has reaction effects and background replacement, the devices of this port's bands
 * (an iPhone 4S, an iPad 2) have neither, and the hardware is the reason in both directions. So this run does
 * two things and does not mix them:
 *
 *   RESPONDS  does each side answer the accessor the registry row names, read out of the port's own header so
 *             a row whose getter=isMultichannelAudioModeSupported would be asked under that name? Both sides
 *             must answer: the claim is that the port carries what Apple's own class carries.
 *   ANSWER    what each side answers, printed side by side. run.sh compares each against
 *             expectations.tsv, which carries BOTH columns and, where they differ, the reason. A row whose two
 *             columns differ is not a failure by itself - the hardware differs - and a row whose column
 *             disagrees with the table is.
 *
 * The two CLASS properties are read out of the APPLICATION's Info.plist, so they are checked four times over,
 * with four plists the harness writes itself and an expectation it computes from the plist it just wrote:
 * tests/backports/host/avf-capabilities/run.sh, the "four Info.plists" phase.
 *
 * Controls, so a run that examined nothing cannot pass:
 *   AVCaptureNoSuchClass              a planted name                -> ABSENT on both sides
 *   AVCaptureDevice (host)            the host's own camera         -> present
 *   charon_host_AVCaptureDevice       the port's renamed copy       -> present
 *   charon_host_AVCaptureDeviceFormat the port's renamed copy       -> present
 *   AVCaptureDeviceFormat (host)      the host's active format      -> present
