#!/bin/sh
# run.sh — measures a framework's exported string constants on the host and diffs them against the
# values this package carries, with tools/corpus/host-probe.c as the instrument.
#
# The two families this covers are HomeKit and AuthenticationServices. For each it asks the host's own
# copy of the framework for every constant the registry lists, and compares. The comparison is the
# point: a port that writes a constant from the name rather than from the release will show up here as
# a difference, and a port that invents one will show up as a name the host does not export.
#
# A framework's *class* names are not string constants and are not asked about: dlsym does not see a
# bare class name (the symbol is _OBJC_CLASS_$_Name), and a class that answered here would be a class
# reported as a constant. The registry's class rows are checked by check-model.sh against the tree
# instead, which is the right instrument for them.
#
# The library comparison needs the two built binaries, named by BUILT_HOMEKIT and
# BUILT_AUTHENTICATIONSERVICES (or BUILT for both) -- a gate run's libHomeKitBackports.dylib and
# libAuthenticationServicesBackports.dylib are what to point them at. Set HOMEKIT_SOURCES to a path
# relative to the repository root to have the code mutation built and shown failing as well.
#
# Run with no arguments it measures both families and writes a table per family into
# coordination/corpus/ledger/constant-values-<framework>.tsv, next to the HomeKit and
# AuthenticationServices ones it reproduces. Exit 0 only when every value agrees.
