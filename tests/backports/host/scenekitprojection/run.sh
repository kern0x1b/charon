# The port's SCNSceneRenderer.projectPoint / unprojectPoint arithmetic, against macOS SceneKit's own
# answers for the same camera, viewport and points.
#
# The backports carry neither method (measured 2026-09-28: `grep -rn projectPoint
# packages/a/apple-backports/` is empty, while the SDK declares both at
# SCNSceneRenderer.h:129-142), so this states the arithmetic the port is given and holds it against
# the system's. It is red, and says so: a view that has not rendered a frame gives the host's
# projectPoint its input back unchanged, so the oracle is not a projection yet. The rendering setup
# this needs is the one tests/backports/host/scenekit/render.swift already has, and the case is
# committed red rather than deleted, because a red case with a verdict is information and a deleted
# one is not.
