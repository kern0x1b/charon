// SecCertificateCopyNormalizedIssuerSequence and SecCertificateCopyNormalizedSubjectSequence, so this is
// a differential and not a self-comparison: the port parses the release's DER and the SDK's answer says
// whether the slice is the right one. No keychain, no SecItem, no identity - the certificate is made
// with SecCertificateCreateWithData from a static blob.
// The HOST'S OWN accessors, reached by dlopen of the SYSTEM framework and dlsym off that handle. Not
// by calling the name: this file defines SecCertificateCopyNormalizedIssuerSequence itself, so a call to
// that name resolves to the PORT's copy and the "differential" would compare the port with itself - which
// is exactly what the first version of this case did, and it passed.
// The walk itself, so MALFORMED INPUT IS EXERCISED rather than assumed: a certificate the host refuses
// to build never reaches the port, so the only way to reach a malformed walk is to hand the reader bytes.
