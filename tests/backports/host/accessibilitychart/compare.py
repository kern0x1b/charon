"""accessibilitychart/compare.py - the two answers against what the case declares.

The file the port's differential reads, expected-differences.tsv, holds the cases the two answers are
expected to differ on, and **it currently holds none**: the three rows it had are gone, because the
family carries the system's behaviour and the port's copies now drop the same three value-typed fields
the system's do. The file is kept because the mechanism is worth keeping - a row added to it has to
carry what the system answers, what the port answers and why - and because a file that says in its own
lines why it is empty is a record where a deleted file is not. What pins those three answers is three
mutants of the case, one per field, not a declaration: a declaration cannot catch a port that starts
agreeing with the host, which is exactly the direction the parity policy cares about.

Four things fail here, and each is a failure of the case rather than a detail it can pass over:

  * a case that differs and is not declared
  * a declared case whose system-side answer has moved
  * a declared case whose port-side answer has moved
  * a declared case that no longer differs at all, so the declaration is stale
  * a side that holds no case at all, which is not a pass and the first version of this reader called it
    one: two empty files are equal, and it printed "0 undeclared or moved" and exited 0

A check that examined nothing would pass every one of these, so the summary line counts the cases it
read and the differences it compared, and both come from the two files on disk.

    Usage: compare.py <host.tsv> <port.tsv> <expected-differences.tsv>
