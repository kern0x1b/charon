"""accessibilitychart/mutate.py - change one line of a copy of the port's source, for mutants.sh.

The copy is a mutant's own, so the change is written to it and never to the tree's file. Two things
about that are checked rather than assumed:

  * the line has to be there, and MUTATE_NTH says which occurrence. The three chart classes each write
    the same two-line title setter, so a text that matches all three and changed the first would break
    one rule and look like it had broken three.
  * the result has to be the whole file. The first version of this read `parts[nth]` as the text after
    the nth occurrence and took only the second piece of it, so a line that occurred twice lost
    everything from the second occurrence to the end of the file - and the mutant then failed to compile
    for a reason that had nothing to do with the rule under test, which is a mutant that tested nothing.
    A mutation whose result is shorter than the change accounts for is refused, and the end of the file
    is compared before anything is written.

Usage: MUTATE=<file> MUTATE_OLD=<text> MUTATE_NEW=<text> MUTATE_NTH=<n> mutate.py
