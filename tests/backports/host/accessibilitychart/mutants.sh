# accessibilitychart/mutants.sh - every mutant of the chart and data classes has to be told apart by
# the case of run.sh, and by the failure report run.sh prints.
#
# A differential that examines nothing says it passed, and a mutant that stops the build says nothing
# either. So each mutant here changes one line of the port's own source in a copy of it, rebuilds the
# case against that copy, and has to be held by one of exactly two of the case's verdicts:
#
#   * the comparison's own - a line of the two answers that do not match, *and* the whole diff that
#     run.sh prints when they do not. Both are required: the diff is a promise the first version of the
#     script could not keep, because `set -e` left it at the comparison, and a mutant that dies without
#     ever reaching the diff has not proved the report is reachable either. The suite fails if no mutant
#     dies that way.
#   * the once-only count of the inert contract - a port that wrote a line per call instead of one per
#     member. The graph's three members are the only inert rows in this group, and this is what holds
#     them.
#
# A mutant that survives, one that dies of a build error, and one that dies of anything else are all
# failures of the case, and the script exits on the count of each.
#
# The rules each mutant breaks, in the order the file applies them:
#   M3  setting a title leaves the attributed face of it behind
#   M1  a value built for a category answers 1 for its number, where the measured answer is 0
#   M2  a value built for a number answers an empty string for its category, where it answers nil
#   M4  the two-argument data point initialiser answers an empty array for its additional values,
#       where the measured answer is nil
#   M5  a copy of a chart carries the direction the original was set to, where the system's copy does not
#   M9  a chart's copy carries the frame the original was set to, like M5 for the other dropped field
#  M10  a numeric axis' copy carries the scale the original was set to, like M5 for the third
#   M6  a numeric axis answers a constant for every value its description provider is given
#   M7  the live audio graph holds an ivar, where the host's instance has none
#   M8  the categorical axis' order is the reverse of what it was given
#  M11  a chart's copy deep-copies its series instead of sharing the original's array
#  M12  a chart's copy copies its x axis instead of sharing it
#  M13  a point's copy copies its x value instead of sharing it
#  M14  a series' copy rebuilds the attributed name instead of sharing the original's string
#  M15  -setDataPoints: does nothing
#  M16  -setXValue: answers the very object it was given, where the system answers a copy of it
#  M17  the chart's -setSummary: does nothing, and no other mutant in this list touches a setter of a
#       string-typed property
#  M18  the say-once guard is gone, so the port writes a line for every call
#  M19  a copy of a chart drops the series, where the six vacuous probes made that invisible
#  M20  a copy of a chart drops the additional axes
#  M21  a copy of a chart drops the summary
#  M22  a copy of a numeric axis drops the gridline positions
#  M23  a copy of a point drops the additional values
#  M24  a copy of a point drops the y value
#
# M19 to M24 exist because six of the twenty-three share probes answered "both-nil": the case had set
# those six fields to nil before it made the copy, two nils compare equal, and a port that dropped the
# field entirely printed the same line as one that shared it. The case now sets each of the six before the
# copy, and each of these six mutants drops one, so each has to turn its own line red.
