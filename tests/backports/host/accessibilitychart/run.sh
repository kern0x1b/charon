# accessibilitychart/run.sh - the chart and data classes of iOS 15.0 against the host's own
# Accessibility.framework.
#
# The system builds these seven classes and the port builds the same seven in
# Accessibility/CharonChartDescriptors.m. The check is: build the same tree in both and ask both the
# same questions, and the two answers must be the same.
#
# It runs on the host because the host has the framework - its SDK carries AXAudiograph.h, the very
# file the port's own SDK of 16.4 carries - and the two implementations are compiled into one program,
# the port's under names the system does not use, so neither can answer for the other. The port half
# links no Accessibility framework: its classes are its own.
#
# Three things are checked that are not a comparison of the two answers, and each says so:
#
#   * the cases whose labels start with "declaration." check a declaration, not the port's code. Their
#     members come from whichever header each side compiled against, so a change to Apple's header moves
#     them and nothing in packages/ can. They are counted apart from the behaviour cases and the summary
#     line says how many of each there were.
#   * AXLiveAudioGraph publishes sound, and a program cannot read sound, so what is compared for it is
#     the shape of the class and how many times each of its three members was called.
#   * the once-only part of the inert contract is a log line, which is not a value, so it is counted on
#     the port alone: the port must write exactly one line per member of the graph however many times the
#     case called it, and the counts it is held to are the ones the case printed. The host writes no such
#     line because the system's three methods publish sound, which is the whole difference between the
#     two implementations here and it is not hidden by leaving it out of the comparison.
#
