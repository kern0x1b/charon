# RTTI, -Os) change nothing in the physics. A copy with one constant changed must differ, or the
# comparison proves nothing. The source is the recipe's own pinned archive, checked by its digest.

# both, as upstream's unoptimised build does here; so the recipe's flags are compared with that join
# turned off, and the host must still diverge with it on, for the reason named.
