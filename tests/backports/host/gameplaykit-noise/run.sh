# run.sh -- the port's noise sources held against what the host's own GameplayKit answers.
#
# The host is the oracle and it is measured, not called: the port's classes and the host's carry the
# same names, and ld64 binds each objc_msgSend$selector stub to one implementation of it, so a process
# with both would answer one of the two for the other. measure.m prints what the host answers and
# differential.m holds the port to those numbers.
#
# With no host framework in the picture the port's names are its own, so nothing is renamed and the
# test calls the port exactly as an application would. What the host answers is in the comment above
# every expectation, and measure.m is the file that produced it.
