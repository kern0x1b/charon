# run.sh -- the port's state machines, entity/component system, behaviours, rules, distributions and
# shuffle held against what the host's own GameplayKit answers.
#
# The host is the oracle and it is measured, not called: the port's classes and the host's carry the same
# names, and ld64 binds each objc_msgSend$selector stub to one implementation of it, so a process with
# both would answer one of the two for the other. measure.m prints what the host answers and
# differential.m holds the port to those numbers; this prints measure.m's own output beside the checks,
# so every expectation can be re-measured rather than trusted.
#
# The port's own sources are compiled with no framework in the picture, so its names are its own and the
# test calls it exactly as an application would.
#
# The random sources are in the object list because the distributions and the shuffle draw through them
# and because -[NSArray shuffledArrayWithRandomSource:] hands the array to the source's own
# -arrayByShufflingObjectsInArray:, which GKRandomSource.m carries. That source is NOT the host's: its
# generators are unidentified and its sequences differ (facts/GameplayKit/GKRandomSource.md), which is
# why the distributions and the shuffle are measured through a written script and not through a seed.
