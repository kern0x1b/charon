// differential.m -- the port's state machines, entity/component system, behaviours, rules,
// distributions and shuffle held against what the host's own GameplayKit answers.
//
// The host is the oracle and it is measured, not called: measure.m prints its answers and every number
// below is one of its lines. run.sh does not load the host's framework beside the port's, because the
// two carry the same selectors and ld64 binds each objc_msgSend$selector stub to one implementation of
// it, so a side-by-side process would answer the host's method where the port's was meant. This links
// Foundation only, so every GK* class in the process is the port's own, named as the SDK's headers name
// it, which is how an application reaching the port finds it.
//
// Three kinds of check appear, and every one of them names the measure.m line it came from:
//   host      the port must answer what the host was measured to answer
//   contract  a property the API promises, with no oracle for it (an archive round trip, a permutation,
//             an order nothing defines)
//   diverge   the two part on purpose and the check fails if they ever stop parting
//
// The distributions and the shuffle are measured through a written script
// (CharonGKScriptedSource.h), because the port's own random generators are NOT the host's -- see
// facts/GameplayKit/GKRandomSource.md, where that is measured -- so no number that came out of one
// source can be compared with the same number out of the other. What has to agree is which protocol
// methods a family reaches for, in which order, and how it combines the answers.
