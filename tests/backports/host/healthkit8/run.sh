# run.sh — the sixteen rows of registry/HealthKit/ios8.json that sit at `absent`, asked of the port and
# of the system's own HealthKit in one process.
#
# The port's classes are compiled under names of their own (CharonHostHKObject and so on) so that the
# system's HealthKit and the port's run side by side and both can be asked the same question, which is
# the only way to find out whether a row's `effect` is true of the port and of the class it is a
# backport of. The eight `-init` rows are the ones this settles: `-init` is `NS_UNAVAILABLE` in the
# header of each of the eight classes, which is a compile-time annotation and says nothing about what
# the class answers at run time, and an inherited method is not a symbol the port exports, so `nm` and
# the gate's own reader both miss it.
#
# Nothing is asked of anybody here: a class answering a selector is class shape, and an allocation
# through `-init` needs no store and no entitlement, so one process holds both halves. The port's
# constants are not compiled in, because the system's HealthKit exports the same symbols and the two
# would collide - the same arrangement tests/backports/host/healthkit/run.sh uses.
#
# The objects this builds are left where they are, under .agent-work/runs/healthkit8 in the checkout,
# because tools/release-split.lua reads a directory of *.o and the band of iOS 8.0 is checked against
# the cache ladder with it. Override with OBJECTSDIR.

# CHARON_HOST_BUILD: this is a host differential - the port's process links no framework of the name it
# measures, so there is no release class for a charon_alias.h proxy to stand in for, nothing for the
# library's loader to re-parent and no name to export. The header's own comment gives the two
# measurements: the macOS linker refuses the metaclass alias ("ld: null objc class data for
# '_OBJC_METACLASS_$_Charon<Name>'", from the smallest file that carries nothing but CHARON_ALIAS), and
# a name built by ## cannot be renamed the way this harness renames classes. What the alias is FOR is a
# device band; here the class of the release's name is the class and every member of it is measured.
