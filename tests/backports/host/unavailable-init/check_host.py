"""check_host.py - the host's own framework against the transcription of what it answered once.

    ./probe <framework-path> <class>            # one class per process: see run.sh
    python3 check_host.py <framework> <the probe's output for that class>

Reads expectations.tsv and the probe's output, and prints one line per class: what the host says now
against what it said when the table was written. A difference is not a failure of the port, it is the
oracle having moved - which is the one thing this table exists to notice, because a table that is never
re-read is a table that has stopped being evidence.

Only the rows whose `oracle` is `host` are asked of the host: a row measured out of a real release's
cache is that release's own answer and this host cannot confirm it. Exits non-zero on any difference and
on a class the host no longer declares at all.
