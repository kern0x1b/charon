# run.sh - the -init and +new that the SDK 26.2 headers of these frameworks close with NS_UNAVAILABLE,
# held to what Apple's own class was measured to do about them.
#
#   1. probe.m asks the host's own framework, ONE CLASS PER PROCESS: is the selector in the class's own
#      method list (the corpus row's question), and what does a caller reach at run time (the behaviour).
#      One process per class because a class's -init can take the host down - measured, PKIdentityElement,
#      PKIdentityIntentToStore, PKIssuerProvisioningExtensionPassEntry and PKVehicleConnectionSession all
#      die with SIGSEGV when initialised directly - and a probe that stopped at the first of those would
#      answer one class and call it a measurement.
#   2. check_host.py holds that against expectations.tsv, per framework, for the rows whose oracle is the
#      host. A difference means the oracle moved, which is the one thing the table exists to notice.
#   3. check_port.py holds the PORT to the same table, per framework: where Apple's class defines a
#      selector, the class's @implementation block must answer with the macro the table names and the
#      compiled object must carry it; where Apple's class carries neither, the block must not define it
#      and the object must not carry it.
#   4. the plants, each of which must turn step 3 red, and the check's own control.
#
# A framework with no host binary at all - HomeKit, whose directory holds only PlugIns - has no host half
# and its rows carry `ios16` as their oracle: the arm64e cache of iOS 16.0, which is a real release's own
# metadata and answers the row's question. There is NO test on the framework path before the probe runs,
# on purpose: this OS ships these frameworks out of the dyld shared cache and there is no file under
# /System/Library/Frameworks/<F>.framework/<F> at all (measured 2026-10-03: the binary comes from the
# cache, the symlink dangles, and dlopen of the same path succeeds). dlopen is the question.
