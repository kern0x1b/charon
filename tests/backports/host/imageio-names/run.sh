#
# WHAT THE COUNT COMPARES, stated honestly because a line count cannot mean both things at once: the two
# raw line counts CANNOT be compared for a mixed tree. With a const-first definitions-only band listed, the
# old check reported "40 declared and 58 defined" and failed, and it was right to fail - 58 is not 40 -
# but the message named a disagreement that was not one: 18 of those 58 are names nothing declares. So the
# count is per NAME now, not per line: names.txt is the union of declared and defined names, and every one
# of them must be defined exactly once. A name declared and not defined fails, and a name defined and not
# declared does not - which is what a definitions-only band is.
