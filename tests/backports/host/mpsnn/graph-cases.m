// graph-cases.m - this port's MPSNNGraph, against the release's own MPSNNGraph, on the same inputs.
//
// Compiled twice from this one file:
//   * the SYSTEM build links the host's MetalPerformanceShaders and builds the graph out of Apple's own
//     MPSNNImageNode, MPSNNAdditionNode and MPSNNGraph. That is the oracle.
//   * the PORT build is marked -DCHARON_PORT_BUILD, is renamed through `rename.h`, and links this
//     package's objects, so the nodes and the graph that build the case are the port's own. A case that
//     ran against the release's class would compare the release with itself, and the `class` lines below
//     say which class each build resolved.
//
// WHY THERE IS A SYSTEM-SIDE BUILD HERE, when tests/backports/host/mpsimage has none: because Apple's own
// MPSNNGraph runs on this machine. Measured, in tests/backports/host/mpsnn/probe.txt, built fresh and
// linked against Metal.framework and MetalPerformanceShaders.framework:
//
//   MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice: class AGXG16SDevice name Apple M4 Pro
//   queue commandBuffer: class AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer
//   empty commit + waitUntilCompleted: OK, status 4, error (none)
//   Apple's MPSNNGraph answers: 11 22 33 44
//
// So the graph's answers are checked against the release's answers, not against numbers written beside
// the inputs. What the previous round of this work recorded instead - that this host's Metal cannot
// commit a command buffer, and that nine of the graph's node classes are absent from the framework - is
// not what the host says. Both of those came out of a probe that asked for four class names no Apple
// header declares (MPSNNAddNode, MPSNNConvolutionNode, MPSNNPoolingMaxNode, MPSNNActivationNode; the
// real ones are MPSNNAdditionNode, MPSCNNConvolutionNode, MPSCNNPoolingMaxNode and MPSCNNNeuronNode) and
// built its command buffer with -[MTLDevice newCommandBuffer], which MTLDevice.h:507-518 does not
// declare: -commandBuffer belongs to MTLCommandQueue, so the object the blame named was never the
// receiver. probe.txt answers both questions with the right names and the framework's own order.
//
// THE FORMAT IS SET TO FLOAT32 ON BOTH SIDES, and that is not cosmetic. MPSNNGraph.h:196 makes a graph's
// `format` default to MPSImageFeatureChannelFormatFloat16, so Apple's result image came back R16Float and
// its four bytes of halfs are 0x4980 0x4d80 0x5020 0x5180 - which decode as 11 22 33 44, and read as
// float32 are 2.69038e+08 6.88875e+10 0 0. The port's destination is allocated from the SOURCE image's own
// channel format ([MPSImage charon_mps_descriptor]), so the port's result is float32 whichever way the
// graph's property is set. Setting the property to Float32 makes the two agree, and the shape line below
// prints the format each side actually produced so a future drift is a printed difference rather than a
// silent one.
//
// Every case prints `case <name> <width>x<height>x<channels> <values...>`, and the values are printed with
// %g so that a float32 the two sides compute differently in the last bit shows as a differing number
// rather than as two spellings of one. What each side said on stderr is kept out of the data: a Metal
// assertion is written to stderr by the driver and would land mid-line in a merged stream.

//
//   * the three-argument pair -writeBytes:dataLayout:imageIndex: and -readBytes:dataLayout:imageIndex: is
//     what the SDK of this machine declares (MPSImage.h:814 and :797) and what the release's MPSImage
//     answers. Measured: with it the release's own image reads back the values written into it.
//   * the port's MPSImage13.m implements the six-argument pair (:334/:353) and the five-argument pair
//     (:372/:382) and neither SDK declares the five-argument one, so it is spelled out through the
//     protocol below. Measured: the release's MPSImage does NOT answer it -
//     "-[MPSImage writeBytes:dataLayout:bytesPerRow:region:imageIndex:]: unrecognized selector sent to
//     instance".
//   * -bytesPerRow on the texture is not a route either: it is a property of the MTLTexture CLASS and not
//     of the MTLTexture protocol, and this host's AGXG16XFamilyTexture does not answer the selector.
//
// So the two helpers below call the pair their own side has. Everything after this point is the same code
// on both sides, which is what makes the comparison one of the graph's answers rather than of the fill.
