// CharonNNReduceReference.h - the reference MPSNNReduce is checked against, in plain C.
//
// This is a NEW file, not an addition to mps-reference.h, for the reason the workspace contract gives:
// MPSNNReduce lives in MPSNeuralNetwork.framework and the MPSImageReduce rows live in MPSImage.framework,
// and one reference header shared by both would be a file whose contents depend on which framework's
// surface the compiler read - the same second-answer problem CharonMPSImage.h:41-44 records when it
// removed a second data-type table.
//
// WHAT THE REFERENCE IS, and what it is not. It is the header's own sentences turned into arithmetic:
//   MPSNNReduce.h:66   "returning the mininmum value for each row of an image"      (the release's spelling)
//   MPSNNReduce.h:93   the same for each column's minimum
//   MPSNNReduce.h:119  "for feature channels of an image"
//   MPSNNReduce.h:173/:199/:225  max, for each row / column / feature channel
//   MPSNNReduce.h:279/:305/:331  mean, for each row / column / feature channel
//   MPSNNReduce.h:357/:383/:410  sum, for each row / column / feature channel
// so the COUNT of answers is the header's: one per row, one per column, one per pixel. It is written
// independently of MPSNNReduce11.m - it takes the source values and the operation as arguments and
// never names the port's class - so a case that agrees is two implementations of one sentence and not
// one implementation compared with itself.
//
// WHERE THE CHANNEL GOES is the one thing the header does not state, and it is decided the same way in
// both: an MPSImage's row is a row of ONE feature channel (MPSCNNKernel carries
// sourceFeatureChannelOffset precisely because a kernel walks one channel at a time), so a row or column
// reduction answers one value per row or column PER CHANNEL and keeps the channel count, while a
// feature-channel reduction crosses channels and so answers one value per pixel into one plane.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: a claim about the release's own numbers. This host's AGX family lacks
// computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType: and the release's own kernel dies encoding with
// '-[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer mtlnext computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:]': unrecognized
// selector, so there is no oracle for the release and no number below is one. What the cases establish
// is that the port's walk is the header's sentence, element for element.
//
// THE BOUND, and why it differs by operation. min, max and sum select or add values the source already
// holds, so they are EXACT and are compared for equality - a copy that moved a bit is a copy that moved
// a bit, and a tolerance here could only hide it. mean divides, and dividing cannot be exact in binary,
// so the sum is taken in double and divided once and the result is within one whole float32 ulp of the
// answer. That is the same split mps-reference.h:276-283 states for the MPSImageReduce rows, applied
// here rather than reinvented: a narrower bound fails every mean case and a wider one would let a real
// defect through a sum.

// Height x Width x FeatureChannels, so `src[(y * cols + x) * channels + c]` is one value - which is
// the layout MPSCNNKernel's own channels and CharonMPSCnnPlane already use.
//
// `out` receives the answers in the layout MPSNNReduce11.m writes them in, and the layout is derived
// from the same three rules on both sides: a row run's values go down the destination's first column, a
// column run's along its first row, a feature-channel run's fill the destination row-major, and a row
// or column run carries the channel it reduced.
// `weighted` says whether the weight applies at all, and the case sets it only for the ONE class that
// declares the property. The header puts `weight` on MPSNNReduceFeatureChannelsSum alone
// (MPSNNReduce.h:413-420) and the release's own cache agrees - of the twelve concrete classes only
// that one lists -weight and -setWeight: - so MPSNNReduceFeatureChannelsMean has no weight to set and
// a mean that is halved by one is a mean of a different kernel.
//
// `dstCols` and `dstChannels` are the DESTINATION's shape, not the source's: a row or column
// reduction's destination is 1 wide and a feature-channel one's holds a single plane, and indexing
// `out` with the source's column count reads the wrong element for every run after the first. That
// was this reference's first defect, and it is why both shapes are named rather than one.
