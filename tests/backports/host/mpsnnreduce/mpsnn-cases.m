// mpsnn-cases.m - is this port's MPSNNReduce the same arithmetic as the header's own sentence?
//
// Compiled twice and run twice, the way tests/backports/host/mpscnn/run.sh does it: once against the
// system's own MPS, once against this port's classes with the MPS names mapped to Charon names and
// their selectors prefixed, so the port's implementations are reached under names of their own and
// cannot be the system's.
//
// WHAT IS COMPARED, and what is not. The system run exists so the harness can say what the RELEASE
// answers, and on this machine it answers nothing: the system's own MPSNNReduceRowSum dies encoding
// with '-[AGXG16XFamilyCommandBuffer mtlnext computeCommandEncoderWithDispatchType:]': unrecognized
// selector, because this host's AGX family does not implement the encoder the framework calls. So the
// comparison that carries weight is port against CharonNNReduceReference.h, which is the header's
// twelve per-class sentences written as arithmetic in plain C and never names the port's class. The
// system run is kept and its result printed, because "the release could not be asked" is a fact a
// reader wants on the transcript rather than in a comment.
//
// THE CLASSES ARE NAMED AS CLASSES and not as strings, which is the whole point of the rename header:
// NSClassFromString is not rewritten by it, so a string literal here would silently reach the
// RELEASE's class and the case would measure the release twice. That is not hypothetical - it is what
// the first version of the mpsimage reduce case did, and it crashed in the release's own encoder.
