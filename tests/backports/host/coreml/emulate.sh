# tests/backports/host/coreml as a device binary under xmake emulate: the Core ML surface on the
# device's own CPU, over the real containers, with every method the registry claims called at least
# once. One heavy job (a build and an emulated boot), so run it in a slot of the machine:
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/host/coreml/emulate.sh
#
# The containers come from .agent-work/runs/coreml-predict/models, the ones the interpreter check
# and the host differential read; embed-models.py writes them into the test's own header, so the
# device reads byte for byte what this host reads. COREML_MINIMUM and COREML_DEVICE name the
# release and the device; 6.1.3 on an iPad 2 is the port's own band.
#
# Leaves the logs in $COREML_BUILD and exits 1 on a failed check, a crash or a boot the emulator
# could not finish.
