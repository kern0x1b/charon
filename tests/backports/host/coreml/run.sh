# run.sh — the Core ML host differential: what this host's own Core ML answers for a set of real
# .mlmodel containers is recorded, the port's classes are then compiled under names of their own
# (Charon<name>) over the port's own reader and interpreter, held to the same record, and each
# difference is either fixed in the port or written down. Mutants of the port each have to be
# caught, so a rule that quietly stops being applied cannot pass.
#
# No container is a recorded divergence: nn_image was one until 2026-10-03, and its cause was this
# port applying the network's own scaler to an array input, which neither Core ML nor coremltools
# does. facts/CoreML/CoreML.md carries the measurement. COREML_DIVERGENT still names a container
# whose prediction numbers are a recorded divergence, for whoever finds the next one.

# with flexible blob shapes and this one has fixed shapes; with `width`/`height` = 32 on both ends

#    being applied. Not one is here: -[MLModel predictionFromFeatures:error:]'s skip of an undefined
#    value, which is the rule that keeps an optional input the caller left out from being sent as an
#    empty value. No container exercises it -- the specification's isOptional is not set on any
#    input of any model tools/coreml/make-models.py writes -- so a mutant of it would survive for a
#    reason that is the corpus's and not the rule's. Writing a container with an optional input is
#    what puts it back, and it is the first thing the next round does.
#
# A mutant is CAUGHT when its record is not the pristine one, and the three ways of arriving are
# told apart and counted apart, because they are three different claims about the port and a single
# number cannot tell a reader which one was made:
#
#   differing  it ran and answered something else. This is the kill mutation testing wants.
#   aborted    it did not finish: killed by a signal or a non-zero exit. Counted caught, and only

#              build above wrote its own record and exited 0, and the guard below refuses to count
#              any mutant without it. A crash is a kill in mutation testing only when the mutation

#              answer; it is asked through @try now (7e3e8f77), so this run reports none.
