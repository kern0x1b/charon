/* The content rule list store, held to what the SYSTEM answered: the same scenario, asked of the port,
 * compared with the answers contentrulelist_system.m recorded on this host with no port code in the
 * process. Compiled WITH renames.sh's flags, so every class name in the scenario is the port's.
 *
 * Three things this checks that a comparison alone does not:
 *
 *   1. That the PORT answered. Both classes exist on the host too, so a build that linked the wrong
 *      objects would compare the system against itself and agree with everything: dladdr on the
 *      answering IMP is what tells the two apart.
 *   2. That no case was lost. A scenario that answered fewer lines than it has cases would agree with
 *      a truncated record, so the count is claimed and checked.
 *   3. That the answers came from a store and not from a stub: the store's own directory is asked for
 *      after a compile, through the filesystem, which is the only place a stored list can be seen from
 *      outside the object.
