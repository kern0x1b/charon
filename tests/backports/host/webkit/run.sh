# run.sh — two things, and both of them have to be able to fail.
#
# 1. The DEVICE side: what the system's WKWebView does for every case of device/webkit-cases.m, under Mac
#    Catalyst, written where the device test reads it, so the port over UIWebView is held to the same ones.
# 2. The HOST differentials, which are what hold the web-extension families to this machine's own WebKit:
#      - webextension.m          the 77 recorded answers of the extension, pattern, action and context families
#      - webextension-controller  the controller family, asked of the SYSTEM with no port code in the process
#                                and then asked of the PORT, with the two answers compared case by case
#      - contentrulelist          the content rule list store of iOS 11, the same shape again: the SYSTEM's
#                                answers recorded against one store directory, then the PORT asked the same
#                                questions against that same directory, which is also what holds the store's
#                                own persistence across the two processes
#
# The controller test exists because a row that says implemented has to be held to something. Neither program
# was built or run by this script before, so a wrong answer in the port could not fail anything: the
# programs are the evidence and they have to be in the loop, and the script's exit status is the whole verdict.
# Each host program is built, run, and its status taken; nothing here is allowed to pass by not running.
