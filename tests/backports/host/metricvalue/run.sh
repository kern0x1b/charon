#!/bin/sh
# run.sh — a host differential for the shared value machinery (packages/a/apple-backports/CharonValueStore.h)
# and for the MetricKit value classes built on it.
#
# What the host can answer: the system's own MetricKit writing a value nothing measured, which is an
# empty object — measured, an MXCPUMetric and an MXMetricPayload this process never filled in give
# -dictionaryRepresentation with no keys and -JSONRepresentation that parses as {}. The port must
# answer that the same way.
#
# What the host cannot answer is a populated value: nothing on the host populates one either, so the
# filled-in half is checked against the port's own contract — exactly the properties the SDK header
# declares, the JSON agreeing with the dictionary, and the archive round trip. The key spelling is a
# choice, and the case file says why.
#
# The three mutations are of the shared machinery itself, which is the point of having it in one
# header: a change to the conversion table or the property walk has to change a record here, or the
# header is not holding anything.
