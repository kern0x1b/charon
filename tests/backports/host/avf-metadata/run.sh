# avf-metadata — the metadata key-space and coordinated-playback constants, the port against the host.
#
# One program (probe-constants.m), linked twice. Linked plain, every name is Apple's own exported
# symbol and the table it prints is the host's. Linked with the rename list and the port's four
# sources, the same names are the port's own definitions, in the same binary as Apple's, and the
# table it prints is the port's. The two tables are then diffed.
#
# Three things this checks that a value-inspection would not:
#
#   * a value the port gets wrong shows up as a diff, not as a passing comparison against itself;
#   * a name the port does not define is a LINK ERROR, so a missing constant cannot read as "both
#     sides absent and therefore equal";
#   * a run that compared nothing fails. The row count is asserted on both sides and against the
#     count this slice claims, so an empty table on either side is a red, not a clean diff of two
#     empty files.
#
# The mutant is the check's own falsifiability: AVFMUTANT=1 perturbs one value in a copy of the
# port's source and the run must go red on exactly that row. A mutant that does not build is RUN
# FAILED and is never counted as noticed - the build step is separate from the diff step for that
# reason.
#
# Usage: sh tests/backports/host/avf-metadata/run.sh          the differential
#        AVFMUTANT=1 sh tests/backports/host/avf-metadata/run.sh   the mutant, which must go red
