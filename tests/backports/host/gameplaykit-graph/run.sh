# run.sh -- the port's pathfinding graphs held against what the host's own GameplayKit answers.
#
# The host is the oracle and it is measured, not called: the port's classes and the host's carry the same
# names, and ld64 binds each objc_msgSend$selector stub to one implementation of it, so a process with both
# would answer one of the two for the other. measure.m prints what the host answers and differential.m holds
# the port to those numbers; run.sh prints measure.m's own output beside the checks, so every expectation can
# be re-measured rather than trusted.
#
# The port's own sources are compiled with no framework in the picture, so its names are its own and the
# test calls it exactly as an application would.
