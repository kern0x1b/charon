// differential.m -- the port's pathfinding graphs held against what the host's own GameplayKit answers.
//
// Every check below names the block of measure.m whose number it came from, and run.sh prints measure.m's own
// output beside the checks, so each one can be re-measured rather than trusted. The port's sources are compiled
// with no GameplayKit framework in the picture, so its classes are the only ones of these names in the process
// and this file calls the port exactly as an application would.
//
// FOUR MEMBERS ARE NOT HELD AGAINST A HOST NUMBER, and each says so in its own check text:
//   * -[GKGraphNode findPathFromNode:] -- the host traps (SIGBUS inside GameplayKit) on every input tried.
//   * -[GKQuadtreeNode quad] -- the host answers the zero quad for every node of every tree tried.
//   * -elementsAtPoint: for an element added with a box or a quad, and -elementsInBox: for a box element
//     -- the host's answers contradict its own header and, at one cell size, its own tree.
//   * the node positions of an obstacle graph -- the host answers NaN for every one of them.
//
// The two float tolerances are the ones the port's own header already records: CharonGK.h:37-38 says the
// host's own float arithmetic is up to two units in the last place away from the correctly rounded division,
// so a distance is compared with a relative slack rather than for equality. Measured on the host: 7.21110249
// for the distance from (9,8) to (3,4), 1.41421354 and 2.23606801 for two grid cells.
