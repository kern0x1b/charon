# run.sh - runs the installer of packages/a/apple-backports/UIKit/UIViewController+TransitionCoordinator.m, the file
# itself and not a copy, against the host's UIKit under Mac Catalyst, a release that has its own UIPresentationController
# and so takes the branch a device from 8.0 on takes (charon_release_presents() is YES here and dead code on 6.1.3). What
# the port's sheet class does is not on the host (the host has its own class of that name); the recorder stands in for the
# one thing the installer asks of it, and the host's own sheet is the presentation controller the handover gives. It holds:
# a controller is asked for its sheet only when it is presented as one (a page or form sheet from a compact width), the
# release presents it through the handover (the style is put back, the caller's delegate is asked for the animators first
# and is back after the dismissal), and the sheet a dismissal took away is not kept.
