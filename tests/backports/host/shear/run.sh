# fraction of the samples, the cause is not attributed, and an object with no registry entry is kept in every
# band from 4.3 and fails check_registry on the built symbols it has no row for. They are in
# `.agent-work/pending-shears/` for the same reason daa379927 put them there, and this harness builds them from
# there so the measurement can be re-run; the headers they include stay at their build paths, where they build

# these functions declares its two buffers `VIMAGE_NON_NULL`, and an attributed parameter is assumed non-null
# inside the function, so at -Os a plain `if (!src)` is folded away and the refusal the release makes is simply
# not in the object. Built this way, the refusals below run against the same arithmetic the bands link, and the
# PLANT control removes the test that survives to show it.
