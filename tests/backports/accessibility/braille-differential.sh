# braille-differential.sh - the braille translation against the host's own AXBrailleTranslator.
#
# The system builds an AXBrailleTable and an AXBrailleTranslator out of a provider's dot patterns,
# and this port builds the same two out of the published Unified English Braille grade 1 tables
# (CharonBraille.m). The check is: give both the same text, and the cells must be the same cells.
#
# It runs on the host because the host has the framework - macOS 26 and later carry
# AXBrailleTranslator, and its Accessibility.framework is in the macOS SDK - and the two
# implementations are compiled into one binary, ours under the name the system does not use, so
# neither can answer for the other. Only the three braille classes are compiled: the request and
# the feature-override session have names the host's Accessibility already has, and building them
# here would collide with it.
#
# Usage: sh tests/backports/accessibility/braille-differential.sh
