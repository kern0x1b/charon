# settings/run.sh - the port's own settings answers, asked of the port's own objects.
#
# The host is not called, and the reason is in check.m's own header: the five settings values read a
# user's preference, AXOpenSettingsFeature opens a window on somebody's screen, and the three hearing
# functions enumerate the signed-in user's accessories. Nothing here is compared with the system, because
# nothing here has a system answer to be compared with; each answer is a reading of the release, measured
# by axs-census.lua, or of the header, and the readings are named next to the assertions.
#
# The control is the program: it asserts that a name which is not the port's is not one of its constants,
# that the port's error domain is not a system domain, and that nothing the library announces is posted.
#
# Usage: sh tests/backports/settings/run.sh
#        ACCESSIBILITY_SRC=<dir>   build another copy of the port's sources (mutants.sh)
#        BUILD=<dir>               where the program and its output go
