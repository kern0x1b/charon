# settings/mutants.sh - every assertion of the settings check has a mutant, and every mutation has a
# control.
#
# The rules, and the mutants that break them:
#   M1  a settings value answers YES, where the release's answer is NO            (the six value answers)
#   M2  a notification is never posted                                            (the observer)
#   M3  the completion is not called at all                                        (the Settings call)
#   M4  the completion is called twice                                            (the Settings call)
#   M5  the completion is called after the function returns                        (the Settings call)
#   M6  the error carries a system domain rather than the port's                  (the Settings call)
#   M7  the error's code is not the feature the caller asked for                   (the Settings call)
#   M8  a notification constant is carried under another name                      (the five constants)
#   M9  the hearing object does not define the streaming-ear function              (nm, not a run)
#  M10  a null completion crashes the port                                        (the Settings call)
#  M11  the control: the sources copied through the same path with nothing changed, which must stay green
#
# A mutant that does not BUILD is "RUN FAILED", never counted as noticed: a mutant that stops the
# compiler has told nobody anything about the answer, which is the defect this file's own M10 exists to
# catch, because the first version of it compiled a mutation that only removed a line and was counted as
# a kill.
