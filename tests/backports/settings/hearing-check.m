// settings/hearing-check.m - the three hearing-device answers, compiled for the port's own target.
//
// Their declarations are API_UNAVAILABLE(macos), so no macOS program can call them and there is no
// macOS oracle to compare with; the machine this is built on has no iOS runtime either. So what is checked
// here is what can be checked without running: the three functions exist with the signatures the header
// gives them, and each one's body is the answer, written so that the compiler is what holds it.
//
// The answers are readings of the release, measured by axs-census.lua: the Accessibility surface a
// release the port carries holds has no hearing device, no pairing and no Bluetooth audio-device symbol
// in it. An empty list for the pairing, the enumeration's own no-device case for the ear, and no for
// bidirectional streaming.
//
// OWED: running this. The program is built for armv7-apple-ios6.0 and there is no iOS runtime on this
// machine, so the answers are held by the compiler and by nm over the built object, not by a run. The
// command that settles it is an emulator run of the built test, and it is named in
// facts/Accessibility/Accessibility.md rather than left as a sentence here.
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <Accessibility/Accessibility.h>
#import <objc/runtime.h>

// Each answer is written once, as a value, and the value is what the function returns. Written this way
// so that changing an answer is a change the compiler rejects at every use, rather than a change one
// function's body and not the other.
