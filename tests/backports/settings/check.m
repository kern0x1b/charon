// settings/check.m - the twelve answers of the settings/functions group, asked of the port's own
// objects and nothing else.
//
// The host is not the oracle for any of them and cannot be:
//
//   * the five settings values read a *user's* preference. On the host that is the signed-in Mac's, which
//     is user data and is nobody's answer to what a phone with no such preference must say. The oracle
//     is the census: 543 AX-prefixed exports in the release's three Accessibility libraries, 339 of them
//     its own AXS names, and not one preference among them about motion, a blinking or insertion cursor,
//     horizontal text layout, borders or a slider alternative.
//   * `AXOpenSettingsFeature` **opens the Settings app**. Calling it on the host would put a window on
//     somebody's screen, so it is not called there under any circumstances.
//   * the three hearing functions enumerate paired accessories, which is the signed-in user's own
//     hardware list, and their declarations are API_UNAVAILABLE on macOS - the header's own statement
//     that a Mac has no such device. They are in hearing-check.m, which is compiled for the port's own
//     target and not run here; the owed line for running it is in
//     facts/Accessibility/Accessibility.md.
//
// So this is a port-only program and each assertion is a reading of the release or of the header, with
// the reading named next to it. What makes the readings mean anything is the controls: the program
// asserts that a name which does not exist is not found, that the port's own error domain is the one the
// failure carries, and that no notification was posted - and every mutant below is one assertion broken
// with a control through the same path, because a check that is red for any reason would otherwise pass.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// The port's own header and NOT the SDK's Accessibility umbrella: the host's SDK has an AXSettings.h of
// its own for macOS 14 and later, and importing both it and this would be two declarations of one
// enumeration, which clang rejects by name. The port's declarations are the ones under test, and the
// umbrella is not needed for anything else here - the five values, the five constants, the assistive
// access flag and the Settings call are all this library's own.
