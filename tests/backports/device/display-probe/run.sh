# tests/backports/device/display-probe.m on an emulated release, built for every combination of the two things a build decides:
# the binary's apple_minimum (4.3, and the release's own where that is a different one) and charon@apple-backports linked or not
# (facts/UIKit/UIDynamicAnimator.md M3). One heavy job, so run it in a slot of the machine:
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/device/display-probe/run.sh 6.1.3
# DISPLAYPROBE_DEVICE names the emulated device (default iPhone3,1, and iPhone4,1 for 6.1.3: the device the release's other device
# programs use); the display the process finds depends on it as well as on the release (facts M3), so a run names both.
# DISPLAYPROBE_CELLS lists the `minimum:package` cells to build (default every one), e.g. "4.3:0 6.0:1".
# Arguments: the release (4.3, 5.1.1, 6.0 or 6.1.3), then optionally the modes to run, each in quotes, `screen view` and so on
# (default: "screen" "screen view" "screen window" "screen turn"; a mode may be named twice, to see whether a run repeats). Each mode is a run of its own, since a display link that
# faults ends the process. DISPLAYPROBE_BUILD is where the builds and the logs go (default a directory of the system temp path);
# copy what a fact cites out of it before it is wiped.
# Exits 1 when a cell fails to configure, build or install, when a run left no report (a fault is the datum, a boot-blocked or timed-out
# run that never printed its `UIScreen screens` line is not), and when DISPLAYPROBE_CELLS names no cell that exists.
# It needs the addon v0.8.11 in the shared xmake store and the firmware of the release, as any port does.
