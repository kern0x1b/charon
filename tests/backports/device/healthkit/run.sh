# run.sh: the port's HealthKit on a 6.1.3 emulator, answering the three questions a device without
# Health data can answer: whether Health data is available, what the authorization status is for a
# process that has asked for nothing, and what error a query of a type the process may not read gives.
# Each is held to what Apple's own headers document, and the release's own HealthKit is the control: on
# 6.1.3 it is absent, and the test prints that the release cannot answer where the port can.
#
# One heavy job - a build and an emulated boot of a release - so run it in a slot of the machine:
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/device/healthkit/run.sh
#
# HEALTHKIT_DEVICE names the device (default iPhone4,1, the 4S, which runs 6.1.3 and has the hardware
# HealthKit asks about), HEALTHKIT_RELEASES the releases (default "6.1.3"), and HEALTHKIT_BUILD where
# the build and the logs go. It needs the addon in the shared xmake store and the firmware of each
# release named. Exits 1 for a program that did not pass.
