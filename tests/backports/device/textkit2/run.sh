# textkit2.m as a device binary under xmake emulate: every implemented method of the range layer of TextKit 2
# called on the release, once per release, and nothing may crash. The port's classes are the only ones of their
# names on 6.1.3 and on 4.3, so this is a call test and not a differential: what each answer is was measured
# against the host's own UIKit (packages/a/apple-backports/facts/UIKit/NSTextRange15.md) and the checks here are
# those rules held on the release. The two releases are the ones the port targets: 6.1.3 and 4.3, so both ends
# of the armv7 range are asked. One heavy job (the package's build and an emulated boot a release), so run it in
# a slot of the machine:
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/device/textkit2/run.sh
# TEXTKIT2_RELEASES lists the releases (default "6.1.3 4.3"), TEXTKIT2_DEVICE the device (default iPhone3,1, the
# 4S, which runs both), TEXTKIT2_BUILD where the builds and the logs go. It needs the addon v0.8.12 in the shared
# xmake store and the firmware of each release. Exits 1 for a release whose checks did not all pass, a run that
# left no report, and a run whose verdict is not a pass.
