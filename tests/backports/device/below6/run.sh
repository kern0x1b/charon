# tests/backports/device/<program>.m for the classes the backports carry below iOS 6, as device binaries run on emulated releases: the
# port's answers on 4.3 and 5.0 are held to the release's own on 6.0 (the `answer` lines), and each program's own checks must pass.
# Two builds (xmake.lua), each with charon@apple-backports linked: "ported", apple_minimum 4.3, run on every release below the class's
# own minimum; "bare", apple_minimum set to the reference release (6.0) itself, run on it alone - "bare" for what band() (modules/
# apple/backports.lua) puts in that band, not for whether the package is linked: at apple_minimum 6.0 it reexports the class instead
# of carrying it, the same way the real apple-backports .deb's own band 6.0 does (checked with nm: no NSProgress/NSUUID class metadata
# there, only a reexport stub). Charon's own "copy the library in" mechanism (charon/AGENTS.md, "charon.libraries and verify_placed")
# copies the band a build's own apple_minimum names, so a "ported" binary (band 4.3, which does carry the class) run on the
# reference release instead would hold two classes of the same name next to the release's real Foundation, and the runtime's own
# choice between them ("which one is undefined") is not a measurement of either. Like tests/backports/device/display-probe/xmake.lua's
# own per-cell apple_minimum, the env var that picks it (BELOW6_MINIMUM) stays exported for configuring, building, installing and
# running alike - xmake emulate install re-reads xmake.lua, so a var exported only around the build step is unset again by the time
# install runs. One heavy job (the package's build and an emulated boot a release), so run it in a slot of the machine:
#     $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh sh tests/backports/device/below6/run.sh nsuuid
# BELOW6_RELEASES lists the releases (default "6.0 4.3 5.0"; the first is the reference, run with the bare build); BELOW6_DEVICE names
# the device (default iPhone2,1, the 3GS, which runs every release named here, and iPhone3,1 for 6.0); BELOW6_UIKIT=1 builds the package
# with UIKit, for a program that needs it; BELOW6_BUILD is where the builds and the logs go. It needs the addon v0.8.12 in the shared
# xmake store and the firmware of each release.
# Exits 1 for a program that did not pass, an answer that differs from the reference's, a run that left no report, and no program named.
