// The port's integer shear engine against the 6.1.3 release's own ARGB8888 shear, over one filter the
// RELEASE made, naming the `(phase, base)` pair each destination sample reads from BOTH engines' bytes. The
// prediction this run answers is tests/backports/device/shearprobe/PREDICTION.md, written before it and not
// edited after; the summary this prints is the deliverable.
//
// WHY PAIRS AND NOT BYTES: 6.1.3 exports `vImageVerticalShear_ARGB8888` and no 16-bit shear at all (the
// sixteen-bit forms arrive at 7.0), so the two engines cannot be handed the same pixel type. The release
// stores `round(sum/divisor)` in the input's own 0..255 units and the port stores `round(sum/rowsum*65535)` in
// 0..65535, and there is no exact relation between those two stored numbers for one convolution. What IS
// comparable, and is the whole of the mapping, is which row of the release's own Q14 table and which source
// pixel each destination sample reads.
//
// HOW A PAIR IS READ OFF ONE ENGINE'S BYTES, with no model of the engine:
//   * the source's channel 0 carries its full value at exactly ONE position along the shear and zero at every
//     other position; every other channel carries its full value everywhere, so the alpha sits at its full
//     value on the path the 8-bit shear takes and nothing else is disturbed;
//   * the backColor is zero, so a tap outside the picture contributes zero rather than a colour;
//   * one shear call then answers, at every destination sample, `store(row[p][j] * max / divisor)` and
//     nothing else, because the only tap with a non-zero argument is the one over the delta and every other
//     weight multiplies a zero. The whole accumulator is therefore ONE tap, and the observed byte names one
//     weight of one row;
//   * repeating that for every position along the axis gives, for each destination sample, the chosen row's
//     own weight profile shifted to where the engine put it. Every `(phase, base)` whose profile reproduces
//     ALL of the observed bytes is a candidate, and how many there are is reported rather than resolved: a
//     negative lobe stores as zero in eight bits and a weight of zero stores as zero too, so some
//     destination samples are genuinely ambiguous and picking one of the candidates would be a guess.
//
// The model in `ShearPredict` is the release's own Q14 integers, either 16384 or the row's own sum as the
// divisor, and the release's measured round-half-up into the stored type. It is v-tail-a12's model, which
// reproduced this device's own bytes 768 of 768 at a scale of one, 1344 of 1344 at two and 480 of 480 at a
// half, and this run identifies under BOTH divisors so the choice is visible rather than assumed.
//
// The port's pair is named TWO ways and both are printed: from the port's bytes by this instrument, and from
// the port's own `CharonResamplePhase` fed the mapping `CharonShearRun` spells. The summary counts the
// destinations where those two disagree, so an instrument that is wrong says so on its own face.
//
// ONE CASE PER PROCESS, through a pipe: on this guest a forked child's writes to standard output do not reach
// the runner's capture (v-crutch6 measured it - twelve children each printed one line and not one line
// arrived), so every case is a forked child whose lines come back through a pipe and are printed by the
// parent, whose own output does arrive. A child that ends on a signal is reported with `WTERMSIG`, never with
// `WEXITSTATUS` alone.

//
// v-tail-a14's `FORMS` ladder scored twelve spellings of the centre and four of them tied at 524 host
// mismatches, and its own report then says all twelve arms computed the same thing - the ladder subtracted
// the half pixel twice. A ladder that cannot tell its own arms apart cannot choose between them, and the
// search stayed open. This one cannot make that mistake: each arm is a separate function of the centre, it is
// checked against a pair read out of the ENGINE'S OWN BYTES rather than out of a model, and the arm the port
// implements is one of the twenty-four and is scored like every other. If the port's arm does not score best
// against the port's own bytes, this file says so on its face.
//
// The four terms, and where each of them was measured (facts/Accelerate/vImageGeometry.md):
//   * the half pixel on the position: present, and it is in the scale's bracket (v-tail-a13);
//   * the translate's sign: inside the bracket, SUBTRACTING on the horizontal and ADDING on the vertical,
//     measured on the host at five scales and on the 6.1.3 guest at one;
//   * the centre's arrangement: NEAR anchored (`position*recip - 0.5`), FAR FACTORED
//     (`A + (position - A)*recip - 0.5`) or FAR DISTRIBUTED (`position*recip + A*(1-recip) - 0.5`). The last
//     two are the same expression and differ by about an ulp, which at an inexact reciprocal is the difference
//     between a centre of 32/64 and one an ulp below it - and the vertical TRUNCATES, so that ulp is a phase;
//   * the phase's rule: ROUND TO NEAREST with the carry that wraps the phase and advances the base, or
//     TRUNCATE with no carry. Measured to be different per axis on the host.
// The arms are ENUMERATED by nested loops, not packed into the bits of an index. The first version packed them
// - half pixel bit 0, sign bit 1, centre bits 2-3, rule bit 4 - and walked twenty-four indices, and the port's
// own arm packs to 27, which no loop of twenty-four reaches: every arm scored a few per cent against the
// PORT'S OWN BYTES, which the port's own `portfn` column reproduces exactly. Two index bugs are in this file's
// record for that reason and both were found the same way, by the instrument scoring its own subject badly.
//
// FOUR terms, and the third and the fourth are this file's own findings rather than inherited ones:
//
//   * the half pixel on the position: present, and it is in the scale's bracket (v-tail-a13);
//   * the translate's sign: inside the bracket, SUBTRACTING on the horizontal and ADDING on the vertical
//     (measured on the host at five scales and on the 6.1.3 guest at one);
//   * the centre's arrangement, SEVEN spellings. NEAR anchored (`position*recip - 0.5`). FAR FACTORED and FAR
//     DISTRIBUTED in double (`A + (position - A)*recip - 0.5` and `position*recip + A*(1 - recip) - 0.5`),
//     which are the same expression and differ by an ulp. The same two with EVERY operation in single
//     precision. And the same two with the POSITION'S PRODUCT in double and the far-edge ANCHOR rounded to
//     single precision - which is the arm that fits, and it is in the table because the release's own bytes put
//     it there: on this Mac's vImage at a scale of 0.75 on the vertical, destination rows 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21
//     and 24 all sit on `frac*phases = 32`, and in double that is exactly 32 at rows 18, 21 and 24 - so a
//     double centre cannot produce the row the release names there - while an anchor rounded to float lands
//     those rows at 31.999918619791515 and rows 6 to 15 at 31.999918619791629. At scales 1, 2, 0.5 and 0.25
//     the reciprocal is a power of two, the anchor is exact in float, and every arm collapses onto the same
//     answer, which is why four of the five scales could never have found this;
//   * the phase's rule: ROUND TO NEAREST with the carry that wraps the phase and advances the base; TRUNCATE
//     with no carry; or CEIL-MINUS-ONE, the largest integer strictly below `frac*phases`, floored at zero.
//     The third is in the table and is REFUTED by this run - see the report - because it fires at a scale of
//     0.5, where `frac*phases` is exactly 16 and the release names row 16.
