// dynamics-watch.m - the shipped UIDynamicAnimator's watch of its reference view (CharonReferenceViewWatch in
// UIDynamicAnimator.mm) on the release it runs on: what wakes a resting animator, and what KVO says when the
// animator or the view is released first (facts/UIKit/UIDynamicAnimator.md M3). Where uiview-kvo.m measures the release's
// KVO with a probe's own observer, this runs the class the backport ships. A command-line program, no UIApplicationMain:
// build it as a daemon target that requires charon@apple-backports with {configs = {uikit = true}} (add_packages and
// set_values("charon.libraries", ...), README's test port) and run it with `xmake emulate -d iPhone4,1 -r 6.1.3 run
// /usr/libexec/<name>`. It exits with the number of failed checks; the KVO line of a leaked observer is on stderr, and
// the run's log is read for it: `was deallocated while key value observers were still registered` must not be there.
