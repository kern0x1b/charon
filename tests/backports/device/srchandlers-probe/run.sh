# What the release itself does with a source's handlers on an emulated iPhone3,1, on every release asked
# for, one scenario per process, through heavy.sh.
#
#   run.sh [release ...]        default 6.1.3; e.g. run.sh 6.1.3 7.1.2 8.4.1 9.3.6
#
# Two measured facts about iOS 6.1.3 started this, and they are what the table at the bottom is for:
#
#   1. libdispatch-228 already runs a source's cancellation and registration handler alone on a concurrent
#      target queue. The shims that used to stand beside those readings are withdrawn - they answered
#      alone=yes where the release already answers alone=yes, and the step where they take the handler off
#      the source ends the process on signal 5 here - so no shim of the cancellation or registration kind is
#      in the binary at all, and the nm gate below refuses a build that has one.
#   2. The same holds for a source's EVENT handler, with or without a barrier block and with or without
#      the barrier event handler's shim, which is on origin/main. That is what put the shim's premise in
#      doubt, and it is active below iOS 10, so 6.1.3 alone cannot decide it: one release is not the range.
#      This runs as many as it is given.
#
# `alone` is only a reading because of the ordinaryasync case: an ordinary block submitted to a concurrent
# target queue answers alone=no on every release measured, so a queue that answered alone=yes would be one
# running a single block at a time, and none of these does. ordinaryevent is the sharper control for the
# event handler: an ordinary block literal as the same source's event handler, which on a release whose
# libdispatch reads no block's flags is exactly what a caller there hands to the setter.
#
# Two things about the guest are measured, not assumed: `xmake emulate run` takes a bare path (a command
# with words after it comes back `fail(spawn error 2)`, and a bare path gives argc=1), so the scenario can
# only be named by forking; and a forked child's writes to this guest's standard output do not reach the
# runner's capture, so a child answers through a pipe and its parent reads it and prints it. fork itself
# works - the six guest checks at the top of the program's output - and run.sh fails if they do not.
#
# The binary is built for the release it runs on, one argument and not two: a reading is a reading of the
# libdispatch that produced it. LC_UUID, not a byte hash: strip rewrites the bytes before the signature and
# ldid -S changes those again, and neither touches LC_UUID. The image is found by that UUID and never by
# `ls -d <prefix>-* | head -1`: a project's configuration is part of its image's name, so each release
# brings a new image and the glob cannot tell them apart.
