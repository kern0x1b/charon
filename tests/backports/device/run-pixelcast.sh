# run-pixelcast.sh — the pixel cast's device run, prepared and not run.
#
# Every step is here and none of it has been executed, because the library the run measures is built
# by the package, and that comes with the coordinator's stack-14 push. Until the installed
# libSceneKitBackports carries `projectPoint` (measured on the store's copy: 0 occurrences), a run
# would measure a library without the code under test, so the provenance check below is not a
# formality - it is what stops that run from being believed.
#
# The order, and why each step is here:
#
#   1. build the probe for the target          the swift-runtime overlays it links are the package's,
#                                             and they are what the push produces
#   2. build the test binary that holds the    an Objective-C device test, already written and
#      backports to macOS                      already compiling for armv7 with 0 errors
#   3. record the provenance of both           LC_UUID, and the bytes up to LC_CODE_SIGNATURE
#   4. install into the image                  xmake emulate install
#   5. check the in-image copies               a different LC_UUID means the install is stale or
#                                             another build, and the run must not be read
#   6. run the test, then the probe             verdicts first, numbers second
#
# Load: the run is only for a machine whose load1 is under 12 with a free slot, and it goes through
# heavy.sh detached. `uptime` is read here, at the moment of the run, and its numbers are quoted in
# the log - a reading taken earlier and copied is not a reading.
