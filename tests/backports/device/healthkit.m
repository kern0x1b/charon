// What a device without Health data answers, and what the release's own HealthKit would have.
//
// The three questions below are PORT-ONLY rows: the release's own HealthKit is not the oracle for any
// of them. On 6.1.3 the release has no HealthKit at all - the armv7 shared cache holds no HealthKit
// image and exports no name of it, measured with NSObject and PassKit as the controls that say the probe
// finds what is there - and a release that had one would not be the oracle either: the store, the
// authorization and the queries are this port's own, so what a release's healthd would answer is an
// answer about a different program. Each row is therefore the port held to what Apple's own headers
// document, and the absence of the release is the control that says none of them is a host comparison.

    // data, and YES where the hardware and the platform are both there. The iPhone 4S and the iPad 2
    // are the devices that run this release and they do have the hardware, so the release's own answer
    // would be YES had it the class at all. The port answers YES for exactly that reason and says why
