// The order Apple documents, as a fact about the header rather than a copy of its text.
//
// UIDropInteraction.h says, as a fact about when each is sent:
//
//   * `dropInteraction:canHandleSession:` gates the rest: if it is not implemented or returns
//     true, the other methods are called "starting with -dropInteraction:sessionDidEnter:". So
//     canHandle is first and sessionDidEnter follows it, and nothing else is sent when it is false.
//   * `dropInteraction:sessionDidEnter:` is "called when a drag enters the view".
//   * `dropInteraction:sessionDidUpdate:` is "called when the drag enters the interaction's view,
//     or when the drag moves while inside the view", and it is the one a delegate must implement to
//     accept a drop at all -- so it is asked on every move, after the enter, before the drop.
//   * `dropInteraction:previewForDroppingItem:withDefault:` is the drop animation's preview, which
//     the header places after `-dropInteraction:performDrop:` has been called, and the port asks
//     it for the drop that is about to be performed, so it is between the update and the perform.
//   * `dropInteraction:performDrop:` is "called when the user drops onto this interaction's view",
//     and the data may be requested "only during the scope of this method".
//   * `dropInteraction:concludeDrop:` is called "after -dropInteraction:performDrop: has been
//     called, and all resulting drop animations have completed", which is the last thing before the
//     view is told to draw its final state.
//   * `dropInteraction:sessionDidEnd:` is called "when the drag session ends, for any reason",
//     "for *every* interaction that ever received sessionDidEnter:, sessionDidUpdate: or
//     sessionDidExit:" -- so it is last, and it is sent even to an interaction that has seen only
//     the enter and the exit.
//
// The strings are the interaction's own selector names with the arguments each message is given, so
// a change in what a message carries fails as well as a change in when it arrives.
//
// The order is asked twice, once over a collection view and once over a table view, because the two
// views' routing is two objects and each has to be told the same thing: what the interaction's
// delegate is called and in what order, and with which arguments.
