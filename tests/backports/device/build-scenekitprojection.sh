# Compiles one device test for the target, which no script in this tree did: tests/backports/README.md
# indexes the tests and what each needs built, and the gates build the backports, but nothing
# assembled the clang line for a test binary. This is that line for scenekitprojection.m, and the
# shape the others take.
#
# The toolchain is the store's own - the same 6.4.0 the package is built with - and the SDK is the
# 16.4 one the armv7 slices come from, which is what `-target armv7-apple-ios6.1.3` needs: a
# deployment target that old has no Swift, and the port supplies it.
#
# Nothing of the package is linked here on purpose: this test asks the *port's* SceneKit for its
# answers, and at compile time the interface is the system's, so what is being checked here is that
# the test compiles against the target at all. The binary that runs is linked against
# libSceneKitBackports and installed with `xmake emulate install`.
