// colour/probe.m - the first nineteen answers of AXNameFromColor, on the host.
//
// AXNameFromColor is ODDED and not carried: the host answers a curated named-colour vocabulary with a
// nearest-match rule and not the components of a colour, so the work is a black-box fit and not a
// lookup, and the fit has not been done. This is the smallest probe that shows the shape of the
// problem, and it is committed so that the fit starts from a reproducible set rather than from a
// number somebody remembers:
//
//   (128,128,128) and (200,200,200) both answer gray        a component answer would say light gray
//   (255,165,0) answers bright orange, (0,0,255) very dark blue, (255,255,0) very light vibrant yellow
//   (128,0,128) and (255,0,255) both answer dark magenta
//
// What is owed, and is in facts/Accessibility/Accessibility.md under Owed: probe the host densely - a
// regular 17x17x17 sRGB grid, 20,000 random colours, the named edge cases, and the neighbours of every
// grid point where the answer changes - identify the vocabulary and the decision rule by fitting
// candidate spaces (sRGB, linear, Lab, OKLab) with per-name prototypes and boundaries found by
// bisection, implement the port's own rule and the port's own prototype table from those measurements,
// and report the agreement over a held-out sample of at least 200,000 colours that were not in the fit
// set. Nothing is read out of the framework's binary or its resources; the names are facts of the
// answers the function returned.
//
// This probe is the host's own function and reads no user data: a colour in, a name out.
