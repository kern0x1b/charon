#!/bin/sh
# colour/run.sh - ask the host's own AXNameFromColor over a dense sample, fit against it, and check the
# answers the fit is measured on.
#
# Four things, in this order:
#
#   1. the probe, built for the host and run over the fit sample, and the size of what it wrote;
#   2. the known-answer check: the 21 edge cases the probe asked, with the answers recorded below, so a
#      host that answered them differently fails this run instead of quietly moving every figure the two
#      fits print. `--wrong-expectation` changes one of the recorded answers on purpose, so the control
#      for the control is in the script: the check must go red, and the run says whether it did;
#   3. the four nearest-prototype agreements, one per colour space the plan named;
#   4. the hue-angle verdict, which is the second model and is wrong too.
#
# What this script does with samples: it writes the fit sample, from a seed it takes or is given, and
# nothing else. There is no held-out sample here and none is claimed - the rule is not identified, so
# nothing has been measured against a sample the rule did not see, and a second probe written before the
# rule exists would be a file that asserts nothing. What is owed is in this directory's README.
#
# Usage: sh tests/backports/colour/run.sh [--wrong-expectation]
#        BUILD=<dir>   where the sample and the probe go
#        SEED=<n>      the sample's seed; the default is the one the recorded numbers came from
