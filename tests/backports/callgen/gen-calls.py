"""Emit a call test for everything a registry says a framework implements.

The gate cannot see a member that has no accessor: `modules/apple/backports.lua`'s
`check_registry` marks a member built as soon as its *owner class* is exported, so a class with
twelve properties and no accessors at all is green. That is not a gap in the gate, it is what the
gate is for; it is a gap nothing else covers, and a review of the first Intents group found
exactly that. A generated call test closes it, and the way it closes it is the point:

  * every class the registry carries is looked up **by name** and must exist;
  * every selector the registry carries is asked for with `respondsToSelector:`, which must
    answer YES — this is the check a declaration, a synthesised property and a missing accessor
    do not all pass, and only one of the three is an implementation;
  * every one of them is then **called**, with neutral arguments of the declared type, and a
    crash is a failure;
  * every property the registry carries is read and written, the same way.

The selectors are called through `objc_msgSend` rather than by their declarations on purpose:
the test has to be able to *ask* whether a selector is there, and a call written against the
header cannot be missing, because the header is what declares it. The types of the arguments come
from the same Objective-C AST the backport's own generator reads, so the neutral value of a
parameter is of the type the header gives it: nil for an object, a block, a pointer or a Class; 0
for a number, an enumeration or a BOOL; a zeroed compound literal for a structure; and a real
error variable for an `NSError **`.

The output is one `.m` of case functions and a JSON manifest of what it calls, so the same
generated file runs unchanged on the host — where it binds the system's own framework and is the
oracle — and on `xmake emulate` at 6.1.3, where it binds the backport. What each run answers is
written as a digest the two are compared with; see compare.py.

Usage:
    tools/callgen/gen-calls.py --sdk <iPhoneOS*.sdk> --registry <dir>... \\
        --out <Calls.m> --manifest <calls.json> [--dump <ast.json>]

    --dump is the AST the generator reads, as tools/intents/gen-intents.py's --dump is; it is
    written beside the SDK once and reused (see dump.sh).
