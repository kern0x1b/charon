# run-host.sh — the generated call test on the host, where it is the oracle.
#
# The host's own Intents.framework answers the same names the registry carries, so this run says
# two things: which of them the system has at all, and what it answers. Run it with
#   sh run-host.sh                       the Intents registry
#   FRAMEWORK=UIKit sh run-host.sh       another one the host carries The port's run says the
# same about libIntentsBackports, and compare.py puts the two side by side. Where they differ the
# registry's own reason is expected to say why - SF Symbols, Siri authorization, the system reading
# a value this port keeps in a store - and every other difference is a finding.
#
# Usage: sh run-host.sh [registry-dir ...]        default: the Intents registry

# A Mac Catalyst binary binds the Command Line Tools' MacOSX.sdk/System/iOSSupport, and that
# directory carries IntentsUI but **not** Intents (measured 2026-09-27 on the host of that day),
# so a Catalyst run cannot be the oracle for this framework. The host's own Intents.framework -
# the one Siri and Shortcuts are built on, in /System/Library/Frameworks - is a macOS framework
# and is in the macOS SDK, so the oracle is a macOS binary linked against that. What it says
# about a name is about the system's own Intents, which is exactly what an oracle is for; the
# classes it does not carry are the iOS-only ones, and compare.py says so rather than failing.
