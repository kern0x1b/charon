# ownership-test.sh - the copy's ownership decision, against properties declared the way the SDK's
# headers declare them, and the behaviour that decision produces.
#
# This is the negative control for the guard that matches a property to its backing ivar. That
# guard missed twice - a property's V_ field carries the ivar name without its leading underscore
# and ivar_getName() carries it with - and each time the effect was that every object ivar was
# copied, which no gate and no registry entry can see.
