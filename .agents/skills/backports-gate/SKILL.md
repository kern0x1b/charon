name: backports-gate
description: Run the apple-backports gate on a charon checkout or worktree and read its verdict — the light guard, the full package gate (all libraries, check_registry, imports), the release-split check and the host-test liveness sweep. Use before sending a backports patch, when merging one, or whenever asked "is this tree green".

# Gating apple-backports

The gate scripts live outside the repository, in `$HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/`. They
read the checkout they are pointed at, live, from disk.

## 1. Light guard (seconds)

```
xmake l $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/run_light_tests.lua "$PWD"
```

Five `tests/addon` suites. Each prints `<name>: OK (0 failures)` or one `<name> FAIL: ...` line
per failure.

- Pass the checkout as the argument; without one it tests the shared checkout
  `$HOME/Git/projects/ios/charon`, not the worktree you are in.

## 2. Full gate (minutes to tens of minutes)

Every edit for the round is done and committed first; then, from the checkout being gated:

```
out=.agent-work/runs/<task>/gate-<n>          # fresh directory per run, never reused
mkdir -p "$out"
$HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/heavy.sh xmake l $HOME/Git/projects/ios/coordination/build-gate.lua 6.1.3 "$PWD/$out" "$PWD" > "$out.log" 2>&1; echo EXIT=$?
```

Pass `timeout: 600000` on the shell call. If the harness backgrounds it, wait for its notification;
check liveness by the `xmake` process and its compiler children, not by the log (it is silent for
long stretches).

Reading the verdict (`$out.log`):

- **Green:** no `error:` line; the log has
  `imports: every non-weak import of the armv7 slices of N binaries resolves against M exports`
  followed by one `.../lib<Framework>Backports.dylib` path per library. When that line goes on with
  `; K weak imports it does not export`, the `warning:` lines above it name each, per library and with the
  cache checked against: a call through NULL at that release unless a check stands in front of it, so read them
  before calling the run green. A package build checks both ends of every band and prints such lines for each.
- **Red:** `error: the registry does not describe what the backports carry:` and the lines under it —
  `built, but no entry in registry/`, `listed as implemented, but nothing of that name is built`,
  `listed as absent, but what is built answers it`, and the rest. Each names symbols; fix the
  registry or the code, not the check.
- `note: N of the registry's entries name no file of facts yet` is a note, not a failure.
- **Red before the registry is read:** `error: the staged bands cannot have their imports checked:`
  and one line per release, `iOS X, an end of the band of iOS P (first to last): xmake firmware
  --arch=A fetch X`. The canon stages every band and checks each against its first and last
  release; the gate names every such cache not held, all at once. Fetch them one at a time (the
  network, not a heavy slot), then gate again: a fetched cache can move a band point earlier and
  with it the end of the band before (measured 2026-09-23, 7.1 -> 7.0.6 -> held), so a second run
  can name a release the first did not.
- `EXIT=0` alone is not green: read the lines above. A pipe or a backgrounded wrapper can hide a
  non-zero exit.

Traps:

- The tree is frozen while the gate runs: `sources()` globs once at the start, so a file added or
  edited mid-run gives a false red or a false green. Edits wait for the next run.
- Argument three is the checkout. Always pass it; never gate by a remembered path.
- A port or test project that requires `charon@apple-backports` with only some of its configs never
  runs `check_registry`: `modules/apple/backports.lua` runs it only when every library in
  `LIBRARIES` was built. Such a green build says nothing about the registry; only this gate does.

## 3. Release split (mandatory after a green build, before handing off)

The gate checks releases on the coarse grid of band points; this checks each symbol against the
cache ladder. `OBJECTSDIR` is one framework directory (the script does not recurse):

```
for d in "$out"/build/objects/*/; do xmake l tools/release-split.lua "$d"; done
```

A flagged file has symbols first exported in more than one release: split it, one release per
object file.

- A release it names is the first held rung that exports the symbol, an upper bound: nothing is held
  between 12.0 and 16.0, so 16.0 means "after 12.0, by 16.0", never a measured 13.0-15.x (the script
  prints each such gap).

- A category has no `nm`-visible symbols, so a clean result says nothing about category files:
  check those by selector-string search against the release caches
  (`$HOME/.charon/dyld/<release>/dyld_shared_cache_armv7`), with a negative control that the
  search finds a selector known to be there.

## 4. Host tests (liveness)

```
sh tests/backports/host/run-all.sh [--seconds N] [NAMES]
```

A sweep: it reports whether each `host/*/run.sh` got past building itself, not whether its checks
pass. A test that stops linking dies silently under `set -eu`; after reviving one, run it in full
and read it for regressions before calling it healthy.

## What goes with a patch

The base commit, what is inside, which of steps 1–4 ran with their verdict lines, and the caveats.

Before `git format-patch`, `git status` must show no rebase or `am` in progress, and `git log -1`
must be your own last commit: during a stopped rebase HEAD is a partly replayed branch, and the
export carries the wrong commits.
The coordinator re-runs the gate after `git am -3`; see the workspace skill `patch-merge`
(`$HOME/Git/projects/ios/.agents/skills/patch-merge/SKILL.md`).
